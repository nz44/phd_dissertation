      "comments  :  [\"There's some major issue with the Drafts section of this app. Changes disappear after 24 hours. Are we supposed to finish off selecting and editing the photos in 24 hours? It's insane if that's the case. It took me around 2 hours yesterday to select and edit the photos for the Lalalab box. I opened the app to make the final changes and order but the changes were lost. It's disappointing! I was pretty excited to order the prints but this sort of issue is totally disgusting.\", \"The pictures are great, but the app not so much. Since a couple of months, 'cause of the latest updates, I can't save drafts or products in the cart anymore, everytime I try to save the draft for an order it goes deleted as soon as I close the app, and I need to restart it all over again.\", \"I ordered the photos for my anniversary to do a wall collage as a surprise and I was told it would arrive by Friday which is why I paid this much to get it on time. The photos never came and I have tried several times to contact the company and zero acknowledgement or response. The tracking doesn't update, it just says shipped so I have no idea when to expect it. Total rip off. Don't buy from here! You'll waste your money.\", \"Ive used this app twice now. Very simple, photos are good quality and you can edit them in numerous ways. If the resolution won't be good enough it does warn you. Very happy with my purchases.\", 'Love it. Easy to use and the magnets look very nice.', 'I made several purchases and just love it, plus I had a problem with a photo book and they gave me the money back in credit to amend the printing. Great Customer Service and efficient. Thank you!', 'Great quality prints, easy to use.', 'Love the quality and customer service! Everyone who visits always asks me where I got my photos from.', \"I love this app. It's easy to use and photos are delivered quickly and they are super detailed.\", 'Used it lots of times. Always happy with the quality of the photos. I love the vintage frames!', 'Love it. Little mini photo boxes are perfect for the baby book 👌 and so easy to get photos from everywhere!!!', \"Excited to download and get some more photos, BUT they aren't currently delivering to my address due to COVID19. I'm fine with that, but I just spent some time setting up an order I was excited about just to be let down. Even a banner on the front page would have helped.\", 'Lovely quality photos, very reasonable price. Discovered this app during lock down, will never go back to photo printing in shops or supermarkets again.', 'Easy to use and great quality pictures.', \"It's a good photo print ordering app. Some more functionality with regards to file selection and page layout would make it even better.\", 'Super product. Easy to use and good quality. Fast delivery', 'Easy to use, wide range of payment methods, option to save a draft.', \"Brilliant! 73 photos for under £5 as you only pay postage! What's not to like...best app ever! Get it people!\", 'Amazing! I had a problem with some photos and the lalateam fastly helpt me! love this app', 'Love the retro print formats and magnets you can make...lovely postcards etc for fridges and wall strings. Fun!', 'Love this app! Good quality photos and pretty fast delivery.', 'Brilliant app. Fantastic service. As new parents we have loved getting the postcards sent to Grandparents and lots of prints for ourselves', 'Quick and easy to use app with great quality prints at really good prices. Is now my only go to printing company!', 'Excellent app, easy, cheap and quick', 'So easy to use. A really fun way to save and share pictures, great prices too', 'Love the vibrant colored designs and the variety of prints!', 'So easy to use, love the print quality! Quick dispatch, simple easy edits. Have already ordered twice!', 'Easy to use, great quality photos in fab formats, great deals!', 'Easy and Simple to use. Great prints and great value!', 'Love it! Good quality photos at good price. The app is really easy to use', 'Definitely recommended this application easy and fast and a good customer service.', 'Very easy to use. Lots of options available and quick delivery.', \"Amazing picture quality. Love all the canvas's i have purchased so far.\", \"Was easy to use to get pics and put a text on each card, can't wait to give them as a gift\", 'App is super easy to use and orders are printed and dispatched quickly!', 'Great products to choose from and lots of cool ways to edit and personalise your photos 👌', 'Very high quality prints and lots of options Vailable. The product is costly compared to competitors however you are garentueed high quality. I am a repeat customer.', 'Excellent quality & very prompt delivery. Highly recommend 👌', \"I am very pleased with my order I did forget to make sure my photos where centered and had many pics with heads cut off. I wasn't aware if this and was given half my money back to reorder so I could adjust the pictures thankyou lalalab for your quick response and for the fast delivery x\", 'Always had great photos, photo magnets, delivery always good']\n",
