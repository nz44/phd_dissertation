pieces of art, and I find it a lot easier to use than say, Medibang Paint (in my experience). The brushes are simple, color, rulers and layout in general. I've used it since I first started drawing digitally, which was what-? I can't even remember how long ago!! I have no complaints, how ever, one suggestion. Please let us sign in with more than Twitter :). It would help a lot :D. Overall, perfect app. 10/10 would recommend., It's an amzing app. I can use it for all my drawingd and it's easy to use. I would and have recommended this to people. But there is just one draw back. This is the fact that i cannot import photos onto a canvas. I do not know why but one morning i had just gone on and it wouldnt let me import then it would crash after trying to load. Very annoying, any way to fix this?? I have already deleted and redownloaded :/, Its becoming irritating.. So I've been using this app for years now, lately its becoming harder to import photos from your gallery. Whenever I try to add a picture to my canvas, it crashes and lags out. I even took the time out of my day to uninstall the app and re-install it. It still doesn't work!! Please fix this, its starting to piss me off even more., I attempted to use Ibis Paint a few times beforehand and didn't even really give it a genuine try. I gave it a genuine try and now I want it to be my main drawing program on my tablet. The brushes are so crisp and clean its blowing my mind. Also it's got a ton of features and textures. I had to buy the version without ads though, kinda couldn't stand them. Personal preference, though., I find it really easy to use and this is the best app I've used so far however I'll have to remove a star because everytime I try to draw something it lags really badly I've tried updating it and it did nothing. Please fix it and I'll add another star. Other than that the app works great and there are plenty of brushes to use. I really recommend it, but if ads are something that bothers you than this app may not be the best for you. It is good but it has way to many ads., A great app, lots of brushes to use, but the only problem is, when you first start, it gets quite confusing (before the tutorial starts anyway). I gave it 5 stars though because you get used to it as you play more. No ads (so far). I've only just got started but as far as I am concerned, this is a nice app to use when you are a beginner or a talented artist., This app is nice,I've used it for 4 years now. But there are some issues that occure sometimes. When I want to import an image,my screen just goes black and does nothing. It's not the first time that this happened but I don't really kno what to do. I stopped using ibis for a while then when I used it again,it worked. So i don't know a proper solution., Ibis Paint X is as good as they come. It's the second drawing app I've ever used that I actually loved, the first being ArtBoard. However, there is one thing that ArtBoard has that Ibis could benefit from. A color mixer! You take two colors, and you can blend them together by moving your finger in a circle. Depending on the direction, you add more of color 1 or 2. It's useful for finding colors, making gradients, and shading!, Hello, I really like this app but for some reason once a draw something it won't let me draw over it and I literally drew it like 3 seconds ago I am not sure why it does that but it would help a whole bunch if it was fixed, also one more thing sometimes when I draw it sends me back to the home page and I think I saw a few other revews about that so I don't thinks it my internet. Thank you for taking your time to read this and if these were fixed I would so happy.😃, This is a great app! I can use it for edits and lots of other stuff! The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because it makes you watch adds for certain brushes,which gets a bit annoying 😥. But in their defense they were trying the art experience easy so the app doesn't give you adds mid-drawing, so they had to add ads somewhere I suppose. But anyways I think its a very good app! I Would recommend!, This app is absolutely amazing but the thing I find annoying and really hate is that it doesn't save you're drawings... Like if you delete the app for a little while and download it back, ALL YOUR ART WORK IS GONE. It's so frustrating to have your hard work GONE, I really hate that and I hope that this change. PLEASE fix this and I'm surprised this issue haven't been fixed., This app is great. I've been using it for years with no problem at all, but one occurred today. I cannot import images at all. I've tried re-installing the app, restarting my device and made sure I had heaps of free room. I don't know if this is the app or my tablet but when U try to import an image, the app closes. If anyone knows how to resolve this issue, please let me know!, The app is Amazing, you don't really need to pay which is a good thing. I'd recommend this to new newbies, it has variety. I would like to see more apps, I'm kinda thinking of an animating app that includes Ibis Paint. The reason is I wanna make animations, but most apps you need to buy. Which makes me lazy, I really want many features like Ibis Paint, and If you do make like an animating app that's has an Ibis Paint crossover thingy. I'm sure it's gonna blow up if you put quality. Ty again, This app is really amazing! I enjoy drawing on it and just doing random doodles. Its easy to use and learn on. Best free app I've tried so far. The reason I gave this app 3 ☆, is because of some bugs. While drawing the app would glitch out and my earased lines would reappear. Another glitch is that when I try to hide a layer it would go on and off. And the most dissapointing glitch was when I was working hard on an almost done drawing when it glitches and disappears. Please fix this. 😭, Its good and all, but why won't it let me import pictures anymore? It was working just fine until the next day, I have an android so when I try to import it, it opens the files app and let's me select the picture I want. but it won't do that anymore. It kicks me out each time I try to import a picture, is there any reason for this?-, This app helped me a LOT to make my avatar and every different drawing I wanted (and wasn't able to) draw on paper! I love this app 10/10! If you want to get an app that is easy to use and doesn't necessarily require any skill then this is the ideal one, it has everything from dip pens to paint brushes, and it's just amazing! 😀😁🤩, Easy to use once you get used to it. I downloaded it last night and I've already done 2 drawings, both of which are the best I've ever done. The stabilizer is amazing (I think that's what it's called). The only problem I have is there's no way (that I can find) to turn something you've selected to a cirtain degree. I'm giving it 5 stars, just in case I haven't found it yet. Amazing app., lt's great! Theres many features, brushes, and just an amazing app in general. Though, when you to use the drawing app for a while it starts to be very laggy and sometimes even crash, l don't mind it much though because it auto-saves my art. 18 hours for the premium brushes after watching ad(s) for 'em is honestly a perfect amount of time! 10/10 l highly reccomend 💙, Basically it is just drawing, but once you delete all of your progress, they are gone forever, there is no retrieving it back, so i would say it would be helpful to add the Button in the setting called ( Retrieve Old Progress ) Basically it would bring back your old progress, even if your on guest. So please add this feature so we wont be stressed, Ibis Paint is my favourite drawing app. There are so many different tools and abilities this app has that I still do not know of, but I'm anxious to learn more! My drawing skills have improved much since I used this app. I also use this magnificent app for editing/redrawing photos. I do not use Ibis Paint for work, I just use it for fun, and to get better at drawing anime. Not there yet that's for sure though! I recommend this app to any anime artists, or just for entertainment you'll love., This app is really it, I use it all the time to draw my lineart, but the best of all is that they also have tutorial videos so you can learn how to draw certain things on their youtube channel, and inside the app. You also don't have to pay to use all the brushes, you just have to watch one ad and then you can use all the brushes for free. The gap recognition needs a bit of work. It fills half of the lineart i'm trying to color, but sometimes it goes outside the lines. Good app overall., I love this app! I have so much fun on it, when I'm grounded from my games like Gacha club and texting story, I listen to music and draw. I have a few complaints though... Every time I'm drawing like a line and trying to be careful with it, it thinks I want the color I'm drawing over, And I Don't really know how to draw a anime character so it would be REALLY helpful for me if you add a tutorial for drawing anime characters in the drawing space thing. Thank you creators of Ibis paint x for this, this app is great! I've been using it for almost two years and I haven't had any complaint about it. But the past weeks I can't really use it cause it works too slowly for me and sometimes it just crashes and then close by itself. My problem is that because of it working too slowly I can't make anything, please help me somehow. I can't do anything, The best app ever! Has amazing brushes, you don't need to buy all fo the brushes all you need to do is watch an add and you get all the brushes for free for 18 hours, I use this to create thumbnails for my videos, art for memes, easy edits it's so fun, it is really easy to use and it has a really helpful tutorial! I definitely recommend!, I like the app it has a wide variety of brushes,backrounds,etc there's just so much they have that I can't name them all I definitely recommend you check It out I'm sure it will be your favorite drawing app the only thing I wish was there was that we could make the canvas longer but you still can make it pretty long so don't make that stop you from downloading it. Some features are locked but you can get premium or have to watch one add every 18 hours and almost every feature is unlocked. Get it, This app is amazing. It has hundreds of brushes and it let's you use layers! I've been using ibis for two years now, yes my phone has reset before and I did lose my art but it's on me because I didn't have an account attached to it. In the years I've used ibis I still dont know what every thing does like the alpha lock, but that's just for me to discover, I LOVE IBIS PAINT X!!! This app is my go-to drawing app. It is not a difficult site, like Krita, beacause Krita has too many tools and is hard to use. ibis Paint X is a very easy to use program. This is also a kid-friendly program!! Kids like me would totally love this app. It has many optoins of brushes and I LOVE the new \"Special\" Tool update. It truly is special!! It has a liquify tool (dragging tool), smoothing tool, expand and shrink tool, etc. It truly is just a wonderful app for all ages., I haven't done much work with full on super advanced art, but as an \"everything\" photo editor it works great. I can easily design a whole advanced Youtube thumbnail with a mix of this and Snapseed for the focusing tool. The only thing I wish this had was a healing tool, but this is an art app not a photo editor. I honestly wish there was a desktop version of this app, I would give it 5 stars if it doesn't show up a black screen when i want to import an image, come on, it's like the 5th time. Maybe it's just my own device, but if this could be fixed, I'm sure giving it 5 stars. I currently can't draw for a long time now, it takes alot of time to put ibis paint normally. When my storage is full, I literally have to uninstall Ibis Paint first., the Magic Wand and the Paint Bucket needs to be fixed. Ive had this app for years and i really love it, but the Magic wand and the Paint Bucket is literally broken for months, whenever i used the Paint Bucket..some of my drawing will be gone or distorted..same for the Magic wand (if i use it many times) so i have to restart and restart and restart the drawing and its tiring me, i also noticed that its not just me that have this problem. Please fix this bug or glitch, its annoying and tiring., Ibis paint is a lovely app, I have had a grand experience! It's so easy, and fun! Usually when I am confused on an app, I would search up how to use it, and this game was a little confusing at first, but after playing around with it for atleast 20 minutes, I was able to use it easily! I was a very bad artist a few years ago, but once I got this app, my art got better and better from the day! Highly recommending this app! 🤩🤩🤩, I give four stars! Amazing app, but, sometimes when i click on the \"Import Picture\", i select an image but then disappear. I hope you can solve this problem. Thank you! I wanted to Give four stars because it's really amazing!You can do whatever you want, and i like that i can draw 3D, sorry if i spell some word wrong but i am a child and i am from italy. Have a nice day!, Update: This is still the best free paint program. However, I have to report that the program crashes now every time I try to import a photo. I hope someone can please fix this. Thanks again for your amazing app. ----- Best ever and free. Thank you guys so much for making this available. The new features are beyond amazing!, This is an easy 4 stars I had to take away 1 star because of the tutorial i uninstalled a week ago and download it again today the tutorial parts keep popping up on the middle of the screen and it's really anoying. However there is not to many adds and I like how you can just watch an add to unlock everything for 2 days and you can keep doing that. I highly recommend downloading this app it's a great help!, It is great! I would recommend if your bad at drawing and you can make so many colors!I LOVE it but the only reason I give it 4 star is because just something's is difficult to do so maybe u can make things a little easier but not to easy i still love a challenge but I would definitely recommend if you love drawing but just not good at it and you can draw anything you heart wants but thank you for this game it is amazing and pls make more games like this in the future,I love this app!, Best drawing app for phone!! Complete features, interesting filters, easy to customize tools, variation of how to save your drawing (it even autosaves your speed-drawing~ Export it to mp4 and you get a speed-drawing of your piece)! Also, it gives you a starting-tutorial (So don't just click ok without reading each of them~👀) It might be confusing at first (for there are so many things you can try🙌), but I promise it'll be fun once you're getting used of it!! Immaculate🥰💯, It's the best drawing app and the most affordable! it has helped me grow as an artist and i'm very grateful about it, but i have some issues, Once i add more layers to my drawings some dots start to appear on them, which makes them appear bad quality, please i'd be happy if you fix this., Very well made app, I have been using it for around 4 years and overall it's a really good art app. It took a bit to get used to the mechanisms and different brushes/filters, but that's a given for any art app. I would highly recommend to beginners and advanced because of how good and easy to use it is., This is great and i totaly reccomend it although there are some weird things about the app..whenever i try to import a picture it always error and im not sure why.ibispaint developer,if by any chance you see this,please fix the bug. Update:okay,so i tried re-installing the app and seems like its working again soooo, if you happen to have a bug like that just uninstall and re-installit:DD, This drawing app is amazing very,enjoyable and usefull! and I really hope this app get more updates to come! .But there is a problem about quality's of images it gets low resolution after saving into a -Png/J.peg- .Please make the quality more better and detailed and please can you make the brushes more dynamic when moving. I hope this app get more better and more updates to come!]   \ncom.canva.editor                                          [Love this app so far, I use it a lot for my blog edits and the results are beautiful. I have only one problem, rather it's a suggestion. I'm a free user and I find the interface a little irritating. The free and premium elements/photos are mixed and it becomes irritating after a while of scrolling. It'll be really amazing if it has a feature of sorting between free and premium one so it'll be easy to have all the free elements in one place for us free version users., Loved this app until it updated. It is less user friendly for many reasons. Previously when picking a canvas I could see a visual and now only the dimensions. Another thing is when adding items such as stickers the options now completely block the project you are working on. I want to be able to see my options to add and see what I already have. The simplicity that made me love the app is no more. I am frustrated and disappointed with the update., Love the new features being added like the format painter and the color picker, but I'm not sure what has happened with the all around functionality. The mobile app is almost useless. I have to \"guess\" on the alignment and sizing of my designs before posting. I end up editing the same file several times just to get what I am seeing on my screen to reflect what is actually saved and downloaded. What is going on? It also keeps freezing the editor because it can't sync up. Help!, Was considering upgrading to the pro version, having remembered it only cost $4/month, but now seeing they raised the monthly rate to $13 dollars... No thank you! I already have an Adobe cloud subscription for all their apps, not worth the money. I can justify $4 a month just to have something for \"ease of use,\" when I don't feel like starting a project in Photoshop, but not the $13., This app works decent for as it is intended, however it's expensive. Even after paying for the premium service there were times when we were asked to pay more for certain decals. We also cancelled the service twice, and they continued to charge us after we cancelled. We didnt find out until we were combing through credit card statements., I really really hate the new version. The old one worked great and I could design something for my business in under 10 mins and have it posted but this new version is absolutely terrible and really laggy. The features are weird and don't work the way the used to and I get so frustrated I'm contemplating ending my membership. Please fix this., The update is the worst! I couldn't even overlay more than 2 photos - it will suddenly turn blank, the quality of photos for FREE USERS got LOWER. When typing text, the project suddenly became so small that I couldn't even see a thing. A side from that the whole app became looks too basic, it almost looks like PICSART! The new design and function of this app is too hard to use. If I could give a ZERO RATING for this app, I will! Now I couldn't even edit my designs., I am a daily user of canva and just love this app for its ease of use, but the latest update is just not working for me. Its cumbersome, not easy to use at all, the adding images from gallery is also not working as it used to earlier. Also other options that were so simple to work on seem complicated now. Didn't like this update at all., @ Canva Dec team. I love your app, i use your website a lot so the recent app updates with added editing features was easy for me to adjust to-thank you for that by the way! The problem I have now is when I save my work and download it, the result is not identical to my work in-app. The text placement is wrong, images have moved, etc. This is devastating as I have no way of fixing this once saved and downloaded. I hope you can fix this issue soon as I love using Canva, but as is I cannot use., Disappointed with the latest update- possible bug? I recently created a brand new design on the PC, then went to use the app to download a copy to my phone, but for whatever reason, it says (even though I have the latest update) that the app needs to be updated before I can do anything besides view it. It won't let me download it or anything. It's a little frustrating, but otherwise, the app does what I need it to do., I cannot get this app to work on my Android tablet. It works fine on my iPhone... I've had it installed on my phone for about 2 years so I don't know if it's because of this update that I keep reading about or not. On my tablet I can't get past the white screen with the teal Circle that says canva. Does anyone know how to fix this? I've already uninstalled and reinstalled twice. I've also tried to force stop. Nothing is working., Dear Canva, I kindly request you to change the structure of Canva and keep it just like before for the mobile version. It is looking too confusing and selecting and editing has become very difficult now. The selection of image, fonts and everything has become way complicated. I love your app, but this is my heartfelt request. Please make it easy, I use the free option. There are lots of great elements. I'd like to thank Canva for reaching out with options. Whether there's been a new update or what I did, the app is working again. This is one of my go to Apps. I do wish when searching you could search better for paid/pro items and free items. It might be an option on desktop, but not mobile. I have not checked. I highly recommend this app., This app is absolutely incredible, it really allows me to express my creativity and the full extent of myself within the content that I make. The tools and options that I have in This application are absolutely phenomenal and they are amazing to use! I highly recommend this for beginners and advanced users!, besides, I like the front view and can see more template options, elements, etc. I am having a hard time after updating recently, because the final result of the design after saving is messy and untidy, so it takes a long time if the editing process uses a smartphone. I prefer the previous version. I would prefer it if adjusted as in the beginning. Thankyou, Canva on mobile is so hard to use. Update: Some features are now available in the app and is now \"somewhat\" easy to use. New concern: the app says i need to update for me to access the design I created using the web interface. I updated the app but the app will still ask me to update. Not changing the rating because of this., My review of Canva after using it for almost 3 years. Canva is undoubtedly the market leader in the online DIY image and graphic design tool. Canva is a great tool to create attractive visuals, and for people like me, it is an excellent replacement to Photoshop as well. But generally, it is not an image editing tool like Photoshop. I am a freelance beauty blogger and writer. Hence, with my limited capabilities and need for graphics editing, it is an excellent substitute to Adobe Photoshop., Honestly the App was incredible before this last update. I just saw I had another update and secretly hoped they were reverting it back some how. I have to do everything on my lap top now which doesn't obviously work due to images being on my phone. Used to take a couple of minutes. Now takes ages. Even just to open it. Pretty disappointing. Legit best editting and self-marketing tool out there. Just this update.... damn, Oh my, they just gave us a new update and it's horrible. The UX is sooooo bad, not user friendly, to many steps just to edit one single element, and boy the result won't be the same as designed. I'm going back to photoshop..thanks., I love using Canva. It is so easy to learn and fun putting pieces together. The one thing I would like to see improved is the sensitivity of the app when switching in and out of zoom views. I have a touchscreen laptop and I use the touchscreen sometimes but the proportions either get super tiny or super large if I'm moving too fast. Other than this, I love it., I am facing challenge while editing any Designs on Canva thru my cellphone app. I have Samsung Galaxy A8 Star and after updating my app, the alignment of the design goes for a toss. The issue persists after reinstallation as well. It works well on web but its always workable doing it on mobile but currently its defeating the purpose.., Major upgrade from Vistaprint. Mobile friendly app, super user friendly modification to designs. Love it. I do all the advertising materials for our small non profit and even printing through them is 1/3 the cost of any other option ive found. Definitely recommend and wish I'd found it sooner., Difficulty to use. You have to brainstorming to understand how the application animation works. It will makes you to consume so much time just to create animated logo. It suddenly crop picture when moving it. no text color setting. Limited choice of text effect color. Not recommended to use, Made a post with multiple lines of text. I can't freely select text & a particular line is shown as massively large than the rest. I make the changes, font etc are same as rest of the text. Then I use the web version, realise changes have been made properly & no text large issue., Excellent app. Friends this app is very user friendly. Once you know how to use it you will be able to design any kind of poster or logo you are looking for. Now no need to go to a cyber cafe or graphic designer to get your logo done., This app was great until the update. It was so much better to navigate through things and bring creations to life. It doesn't seem to have the same mobile capability as before. Just as others have said,, I too create things and after viewing them in my phone gallery,, everything is all out of place. Like the saying goes if it's not broke don't fix it. I am very irritated with the new way! Bring the previous way back!!!!, This app used to be good, but now when I add animations, the size of the texts become smaller and move to the corner whenever I play it. However everything is normal without animation. I don't know why, because it used to work, I used to give 4 stars, before the new update. Seriously regret this. Could you just add another things without changing how it's work before? I spent a lot of time editting, struggling with the new navigation pane. End up, when i downloaded the images, they're totally different than my design. You waste my time. Please convert it like before or else I'll just uninstall this non-functional design app., Canva makes my post look so much more professional! I love that there are so many options! The one complaint I would have is for there to be a bigger representation of Black Men, Women, & Children! Overall this is a great tool!, Update: Browsing my local files is very slow (loading) and glitchy. When I delete some files from my gallery to once again browse them through the app, not all files show up. Initial review: Not a fan of the new update. I can't replace an element with a solid color anymore (which I use as a placeholder for content to add in the future)., I love the previous version. This new version is totally a mess. Everything messed up. When I download either to JPG or PDF, every font & element size change automatically. As the result, it turns to something really different with my original design :( :( :( I used my android phone. But it works well on my pc. Unfortunately it's really not convenient if I have to use it on my pc only. I prefer to designing on my phone. Please fix it!, I really do not appreciate the current UI of the app. It is more PC/laptop friendly rather than it being mobile friendly. It's so difficult to be able to navigate around and there are so many features that are not there any more. It's become difficult to locate and edit images and videos. Really upset on the recent update and UI., This app was almost perfect on a phone. Quite buggy online but the phone app was so much better. Until it just updated, I will leave it installed on my phone for a few months but unless it changes will not use it again, so glad I never paid for it. What a disappointment, I just don't understand how you can take a great app, and update it to something that is almost unusable. Simple example, how do I rename something I have created? I'm searching for an alternative now., So Heartbroken After The Update. Same issues as everyone else. I used this app EVERYDAY for my business. I could swoop in create something awesome in 2 seconds and be done. Now I can barely use it. No matter what I save, its completely messed up and not formatted correctly when I post it to social media. Adding text I can't use my spacebar. Takes forever to move or reposition items. I was about to purchase Pro but now I can't use the app. Please allow us to have the old version back!?!?, Awesome app. Helps me prepare presentations, design simple stuff and whole bunch of things all for free. Planning to switch to premium soon. Totally worth it. Also need to mention that it might crash if your device isn't very strong, Canva Pro is a valuable accept for small businesses who cannot afford to fit creative website design into their budget. and Canva is also a great app that can be used for earning a decent side income by creating templates for advertising and promotional pages that are in social media format. Canva can also be used to make animated videos, business cards, brochures, logos, and other types of creative's. I give this app a full five stars. Oh and I almost forgot pro members can invite 4 friends., WAS good, now it looks like they're trying to bring the desktop UI/experience to mobile which renders the whole point of getting an app useless; Text blocks constantly resize and its an extreme hassle to even delete the \"lorum ipsum\". I was excited to see it was renovated until I started using it. I'll just go back to the version on my laptop Edit: Uninstalling the app from my phone. It's no longer functional on an S20 ultra which is beyond me. I'll be going back to the desktop version., Latest update sucks!! All my previous designs have had the formatting thrown out of whack. It's laggy, glitchy, freezes, reverts back to home page without prompting. The designs home page doesn't show the latest designs, and are 'stuck' mid edit. Horrible! Fix the latest update bugs and it's a brilliant, addictive, and easy to use app. One of my favourites prior to the latest update., First review was *****. Now, though, after the most recent update, I can't use it on my S20 Ultra. The image it saves is not the image I've created, the text runs off the screen with no way to adjust it. I really hope another update is pushed through fast! Update: The new update made things marginally better, and I was able to create a beautiful instagram post. However, when uploaded to instagram, the text is sacrificed up in one area of the image and it doesn't look at all like what I'd made., When I opened the app on my tablet one day, I couldn't add or make new designs anymore. So now, I have to either edit my old designs to make new ones, or use and edit templates. It's frustrating. I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this, but I hope this can be fixed. Also, I tried making a design on my laptop using the website, and was annoyed to find out that I can't download designs on there unless I pay for Canva Pro. Canva is good, but I wish they weren't so desperate for money.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \ncom.doodle.master.draw.glow.art                           [This game is great. It has sooo many colors to chose from and I love how when you draw something it draws it on all the sides and it has no adds at all hopefully I will study because I'm playing and playing all the time I am turning dum this game is great I love it I am adictid to it I'm just stuck to it I talk TOO MUCH so I'm going to stop but I still have a lot more to say Download this game now on play store gosh I'm done ill continue my art masterpiece. BYE, I love the app but the ads are getting a little annoying and every time I try to make a things it always goes straight to the video and I'm not even pressing anything but I figured out how to fix it. I am very happy with the app I hope this is helpful if you're even reading this long of a paragraph., This app is the best! Whoever made this app has a unique way to think of art. This is verry cool. I love how many options and how easy it is to draw on this app. Its not to complicated. There is one prob... you figured it out... ADDS! I still give 5 star rating bcs most of the time games have a lot of adds so I am used to it :v, I think it's a good game. It's very simple it's also good for children and adults but I have one problem about this! There's to many ads I put on airplane and it was fine. But it in li y worked one time. Other than that it's a good game I would have rated 4 stars after the other reviews but once I tried it was wonderful! This should get updated soon., I really enjoy this app, but I have a problem. When I try to export the clip it always export it in a super extra ultra slow motion. Am I doing something wrong? Would love to be able to shere the clips in the actual speed I choose. Tried exporting it and also direct upload to other apps and always the same problem. Please fix. And thank you for a fun/awesome app!, I love this app!!! My mom draw scribles in this app and then after a few minutes i show her a masterpiece out of her scribles!!! I really recomend this app ! Its so much fun!!! But be aware, if u wanna have fun u gotta get through some adds. Pls kick out the adds!! After that te app is amazing!!!! Oh, and i forgot it can be used with or without internet conection !!!🙂👏👏👏👏👏, Amazing app. Very calming and easy. The glow art is so much fun. You touch the pad and you have already made a glamorous glow art masterpiece piece! it's so satisfying and beautiful when you watch yourself fo it after you've finished. I recommend this app if you are into easy art, This is the most amazing app ever it's the best super FUN. But the only thing not really fun about it is when you finish you're creation theres an add and at first i couldn't really save the video because first you need to allow it the creators of this game should definitely puta all the things that you need to allow when you open you're app for the very first time so hopefully that gets fixed soon for all the new users of this game but overall it's awesome, I really love this game, And uhm you should remove the ads but I'm used to the ads so download this game. If the ads disturb you, just put it on airplane mode or turn off the wifi on your phone 😊, Think this game is really fun and other than the continuous adds I can't think of too much else wrong with it. But if you're a person who likes to play really fun running games or anything than this game probably isn't the one for you, since it is a relaxing, unwinding game. Keep it up guys, I I give this game of five stars because it is so fun so easy and you can make cool art and put it on your Instagram Facebook like stuff like that it's the best so make sure to download this game it is free on the app store I just love it so I didn't recommend to play this game it's very satisfying ok so that it it's the best I recommended it so good and 10 out of 10 five star review, This is the best game ever I'm like what I want to try makes it into three different colors and most of all I can share with all my friends that's why I really think I understand but I guess you can't do that but I like this game it's feeling my mind and my eyes and my nose with art so I just wanted to say thank you for creating this game. 🥰😘🤩, Its an amazing app, but the only reson im rating it a 4 star is because every peice of art I finish there is always an add. I hope this will get fixed soon. Other than that I really enjoy it, and I recemend this app! Keep up the good work!! 😊, I love this app because it has a lot of fun and different colours to make you something you can be fun to watch and play in your life as well if you're looking to get the amongas and other artists are not just a little bit different but they have a great variety and they have the same qualities and abilities to be able and they can I love them for their music but they do it all in a lot to me but they don't want me because they have a great deal with the music they are in and they have to do som, This App is rely nice but,I have on problem The only problem are the ads after you finish an art piece That's the only problem but still it's a really nice app I am positive that this app needs 5 star 🤩🤩😂😎🤑, Very good game , I love do draw and this is game is perfect! But there is too many ads , every time I want to watch the video of the drawing there is A ad but very great game you should download it!, •I give it a 4 star rate first imma explain its great! Its really relaxing and wonderful and it improves your drawing skills and the bad stuff about it... there r a lot of ads like when im finish drawing a ad comes up but although its a great game! For the next update can u not put so many ads pls? Thank you!•, I think that u shouldn't have to pay for some of the designs. But overall I think its a really good app if u like art and I don't really like art but I enjoyed this app.Another problem I had was that there was so many adds., I was bored in my house and asked my dad if I could color on his iPad and he said yes so I downloaded this app and started coloring and I figured out that you could duplicate the lines and It was really cool and there were also videos of the lines moving but the only thing that I didn't like was the fact that there were so many ad's, Nice game. Very beautiful colors ❤️I draw a good photos. I really like this game. This app is for who likes drawing. But there are many ads, but not problem, I like this game so much but only 1 problem that after our drawing we have to see the ads anyways I will tell you to play the this game and who have made this app I'm telling to them only that plz dont show us the ads plz, Its ok, but it would be a lot better if you had at least ten more colors added to this doodle master. It would be more suitable for children., Love this app 💝💝💝💝💝💝 It is a great app for those who want to draw and don't mind advertisements I would give it a four and a half because of the advertisements, This game is amazing! It's that one that you see on tik tok where it makes a symmetrical image. I have been looking for this app and am already using it heaps, you can also playback you're artwork which is cool., It lets me draw even when I don't have any paper around and if I don't like what I drew I can just delete it! It's one of the best drawing apps I've had, I love this app it has so beautiful thing like i just doodle and it becomes such a beautiful art and i like to spend all my free time on it. The thing i liked is that it is also offline and like i am going on a trip so i will certainly not get bored after using this app, This is the coolest thing ever, it looks hard, and hard to become a pro at, but it's like it takes over your mind, and u end up drawing the COOLEST \"stuff\" ever!, I think it is great but if you could Just make sure that the pictures don't get muddled around.And make sure that there is no adds that would be very nice. why won't it let me save it without adds.Please can you change it., There a few adds when your done but there's nothing wrong with the game it's fun but you need premium to unlock the other stuff to draw with or you can use adds there not that much to do on the game all you do is draw or dodle ya and that's it peeps!!!!!😇💚💙🌟 stay safe, One of the best games I've played you can do whatever personaly I am an arty person and when I have finished I print and use it as a card 4 stars because after ur peice advert., Can you just put a little bit of ads because its not fun when there are so many ads. when I click the finish an ad will appear everytime.Can u fix it or update this game.THX, Doodle Master - Glow Art is a great app the colours are just so nice and bright and there even rannow. And there really now wrong way to do it it makes even the worst art look amazing., Very fun app, I would get premium if it wasn't that much but I'm fine with a ad every time I wanna get extra colors, but it's quite annoying getting an ad everytime I exit something., This is a great game and also so satisfying. However, when you want to save the image, there is a sponsor for each time you save the image. It gets annoying when I get these sponsors every time. Overall, this is a great game for you to play and unwind with., It is a really good game great time killer and everything but I do think that there is a little to many ads after every drawing you have an ad but other than that it is awesome, I liked this app a lot but there arent as many drawing options as there can be suppose: Undo and redo and blur and smudge.This app is very good though., I could literally play this game all night. This game is like whatever you draw is beautiful using this game like OMG I really like it, keep up with the great work!, Love this app Im giving only 4stars because it sometimes gliches and re toooooo many adds . Hope you can reduce the number of adds . And fix the little glitches ... But in the end its totally worth it ☺️, I really love this game it is so much fun you can literally design anything but... the thing that is most frustrating is that there is ads everywhere after your done drawing something so this game is going way over board with the ads, Its a great game and I'll play it all day long so relaxing and exciting for beginners of the arts the only problem is all the ads they keep you from doing the art but besides that it's a great game]

least half of the options were free or you could watch ads to gain more options. An app shouldn't make money by giving people no option other than buying premium. It should be good enough that people want premium because they enjoy it and want to go the next step up. It feels forced and I don't want to have to buy premium because I know Adobe always raises prices regularly, I absolutely love Spark Post. I use it on both my phone and chromebook for all of my graphic design needs. I broke down and purchased a subscription and I have not regretted it AT ALL. Aside from having maybe too much to choose from now 😁. I will say that the app gets into a \"mood\" from time to time and that can be quite frustrating, but thats when I just switch over to the chromebook. Awesome program all around though, please don't ever get rid of it, Adobe!!!!, I used to like this, but now it won't even export my designs to my phone. I've been a long time user of Adobe products as a professional photographer, and never have issues with the lightroom, or photoshop, as a CC membership holder, I thought I'd try this for my Insta stories. Edit: I revisited after trying a bunch of other apps, and it's getting better! It's a little buggy depending on what device I'm using it on, but I'm liking the new features! I'll give it another star. 3 instead of 2., I was struggling to find an application that could allow me to use my phone just the same as I would use Publiser on my Laptop ans when I found this man was I elated! I love it, it's super easy to use, it has lots of templates to use and on top of that you can custom design your own posters! I'd suggest it to anyone!, This last update screwed me. Some of the fonts, including the one I use for my marketing material, has switched and now looks like the font I have my phone set to (cool jazz). Every post I have saved has for some reason switched the font to something to resembles cool jazz. UPDATE: I switched the font on my phone back to the original font and restarted my phone. That seems to have fixed the issue., I love the app and I enjoyed using it but I wish the features of controlling every layer should bring to live. Like sending back the first layer to backward. Viseversa. Wish the Developer will give all the user more freedom to do how we want to create and customized things depending on the assets, I make Youtube videos and I have found this app most helpful in creating thumbnails, logos and water marks. You can pay for more features but I found the free version was more then adequate for creating professional looking images. I have tried a variety of other apps and this one seems to have the best features all on the one app., Super cool. You can create really good post or wallpaper or somthing like that even in free version. They give lot of features for the free version like animations, thousands of icons and images and lot more. I didn't see any ads since i downloaded this. Really useful. Really easy to use., I Loooove this app!! It's so convenient and easy to use on my phone when I'm on the go. I love to use it for my YouTube thumbnails as well as my Salon advertisements. The uses are endless!! Great job Adobe!!, Icons are nice. Fonts are nice. Everything about it is just so convenient. Please do consider adding a zoom-in function because it's really hard editing on a phone🥺 this app is what I use for school projects and I'd say it's the best one yet., I think spark post is the best and l love the functions and setup and I appreciate what they can up with the option of removing the logo on the picture and It is a very nice app to use and I think they can reach at a point of becoming better than Canva if the keep up with the good work, Great app! I use it for my book covers on Wattpad and they always draw attention! If you're looking for an easy app to use for covers or youtube thumbnails, this is the one for you!, Its very Good! The only thing is sometimes when I put a Png, it forgets to cut it in a few parts But the cutting is very good. In General, this app is good to edit photos, Very straightforward app. User friendly. It's not blotted with a lot of unnecessary features and fonts. Top marks., Took me a minute to figure out how to use to my advantage on each design. Do not like the water remove fee. Is it included when I register and pay for subscription to Adobe DC fill and sign?, This app is incredible! I love how easy it makes it to add your branding to any image/video. Better than any of the alternatives I've tried., Every update is frustrating! Anything you create and save reverts back to its old form when you repoen it. All changes get lost! Why can't this be a stable app ever?, it is a great app really, but for the watermarks though 🤦‍♂️ not all of us can manage subscription fees we still young please, other wise I highly recommend it!, Great Content Creation on the Go. The free version offers a lot of functionality. One can get really good looking content with this app. Can give canva a good run for its money., Amazing editor. Free version is fantastic and offers more than what i need. Highly recommended., tried 10 apps @20mb and under ; some came close but none worked w/o high anxiety . . 60mb was the charm . . there's just too much going on technically to do this low budget ; which is why there's a video after ea pic. The beta here works but you have to poke around a bit. I hope you keep it ., It was a great app before this update but now there is no shapes option that attracts the most. I want that shape option back this update is not good., Love it! Super easy to use. The more that I create things the easier it gets. I'm so glad there is a mobile app so that I can take care of business the go!, the font issue has been fixed, unfortunately I had no opportunity to e-mail them about the problem... this is a really great application if you want to make something quickly or let your creativity run wild. I think subscription prices could be cheaper, but dont let that discourage you from downloading. You will enjoy every moment designing with this app., Completely awesome... I only wish the animation could be used differently for each sentence on the same page, What an amazing app, fantastic for creating graphics and designing your own content. Best app i have used., Even without an Adobe subscription it's easy to use and produces professional results., Great free pics provided, tools have been updated, fun and easy to use., Im giving 5 for making it easy for people to learn basics. Need some more tools and options for making animated posters and colorful icons., The New Update is great! II have been using this for my stories for over a year now and no issues what so ever. Just a suggestion for the grids when making a poster is could you add some diagonal grids. I like to make a stories a little more enticing. If that comes in the next update. I'll be happy!, This app is great for making anything creative like invitations, wallpapers, collages and creating beautiful backgrounds with a wide range of pictures on the platform to use. The only thing is that there aren't a lot of font options to choose from and they aren't very exciting the ones that are there. Other than that, there are many templates to use as well and more. I totally reccomend you use Adobe Spark Post for any of your creative needs! Go install it!, I like Adobe spark post enough to continue using it. However it can improve. There a glitches when it comes to ongoing jobs. If started on the phone app, they may not show on the desktop version and vice-versa. Also, the phone app has fewer possibilities in the editing process in comparison to the desktop version, which limits the best work to a computer environment and, as a business owner, I tend to be on the go more than on a desk. Other than that, I am pleased., This was a wonderful app before you decided to remove the \"Design\" option. It was quick and easy way for me to find to a preferred templet and tinker with it a little till I get what I what. I'm not a creative genius so I need some hand holding and now that's gone. Please bring it back Edit: Thanks for the update. 5 stars again. Edit 2: Now why does the Design option not shuffle the text and the position as I see in the preview? It keeps changing the colour. Is it just me?, Be very careful. I downloaded the app via Google and paid for the full subscription. This, it seems, was done by a Google and not Adobe. When I got a new phone, I was logged out and when I launched the app from the new phone, it went to an Adobe log in screen. I put in my email and password and it created a new account and over wrote all my previous work. It also meant the subscription was no longer recognised. Apparently I should have logged back in via Google. There is no pre warning of this, Best for designing on mobile, but had a bug from last 2-3 months. Sometimes it goes like I am designing my post and all of a sudden everything on canvas vanishes or lost and after this you have to start designing from the beginning., I really enjoy this app. I had it on my other phone and I was at work trying to find an app that I could use to make flyers. I am glad I remembered this app. And you can even remove the Spark logo on the free acct. I am really contemplating becoming a paid member., It is an awesome tool for a global teacher like me. I create digital content and lesson materials for my students on the go, using the adobe spark. It has been very useful. I purchased the premium package and my content have been awesome. Thank you for developing and always improving on the app. 👍👌🥰, I love this app so much. the only thing I hate about it is that at some point it freezes and closes by it self, Any learning designer will be lucky to have Spark Post. It's easy to use. It brings to life whatever you envision. It also gives you options like templates to jump start your creative side., I love this app, but it can be very buggy. And when I have a deadline to put out a flier or whatever, having to restart/reinstall the app just to have certain features work, it's a huge hindrance on my work/time. Ie. Cannot search for templates through app. Searching through browser works, but I can't transfer any of them to the app. Also the spacing on the boxes around lettering will change or move for no reason and won't allow me to line things up properly until I close the app and restart]

I played it when I didn't have a computer and hadn't even heard of star stable. This game could use some alternations. But other than that highly recommend great for children just be carful with the buying feature!, Star stable horses is a great app, if you play star stable online. Star stable online is a horse game and sometimes they update this app and they bring in new horses to this app. So you raise them from a foal to a horse. And after they reach level 10, you can buy that horse with star coins ( that cost real money ) to transfer that horse into star stable so you can ride it. So this is a really good app if you have star stable online., I love this app, but I would like to be able to rase more then two horses at ones. I also wish that you could see each other training. Also, I wish that it didn't cost ster coins., They should make it so that all the stalls are free plz do make all the stalls free and other than that it is amazing!...... I just edited my review and I uninstalled the app now it won't redownload I'm very sad cause there is a new horse but my little sister has the the app on her phone and she got the new horse for me... Well Byeeeeee! I'm still sad tho..., Awesome app! But it could use some changes. I dont like how you have to wait like a few days to level them up and put them in the game.And i thought the horses were free to put in the game not logging in and buying with star coins and please update where you dont have to buy anything.It would really be fun if the horses were free to put in the game! Please read this star stable and update!! Thanks! Love sso by the way!, Great Game! I love it. There's just a little twist. When your horses are level 10, you go on horse stables online. I made my character and horse on apple IPhone, but it wasn't letting me in because I might need a computer I dont remember if you need a computer because it was back in 2019., This game is amazing but when you transfer horses it says eror and I keep trying but it doesn't work. I even try re-installing it., I really like this game and I can see that a lot of people are complaining about the star coins to transporter the horse but if you create a new account you press on the gift and get free gifts and it is way cheaper than in game only 25 star coins most horses are like 4985 for example star coins its a big difference., I love the game, you train up the horses and transfer them to the game. But...The animations for one, are lusitano and another idk. Two, I'm not hating but why do you have to wait longer and longer to finish training the horse. Otherwise it's a good game and I would recommend. Also Sunshine Davis-Ray... The game is FOR LEVELING UP **FOALS** TO PUT IN THE ACTUAL GAME. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT IF YOU DONT HAVE THE GAME!, This app is cool! I would recommend people to download this app! This app is about having your own horses to take care of. But, the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I cannot go to star stables online which is only on PC and Mac to transfer my level 10 horses. But, as I said it is still a good game., This game is the best game on the entire planet.I've had this game for 4 years and I am in Love with it.The updates are incredible and the horses were to begin,they are beautiful DEFINATLEY a 5 star review!🐎💖💖, I really recommend this game but it takes a while to play it on the laptop I've been waiting all day, Ok my past review was stupid, I love this game all the way and love all the hard work you guys put into this and your bigger game sso. I appreciate all the hard work and the hours you and your team do day after day. Thank you for making this so enjoyable star stable! 💕, Great game nonetheless but I have a star stable account but I don't have a PC or Mac and I can't play star stable and I hope you can make star stable online for mobile users too. And please add more horses because they all look amazing, I love this game but you can only have two horses unless your willing to spend real money. Also the graphics are good but you have to wait until the next day for more levels. I would give a 5 star but, i am not that happy I am told that the computer version is better. I would recommend this game to horse lovers., Hello star stable can you soon add a limited edition horse on this game. I love star stable online and I think its wonderful. But for the next limited edition horse can it be 750 star coins. Thank you! Kind regards Your craziest fan who who plays sso, It's honestly well-made. These people who are complaining about \"Oh! It's costs so much like I can't afford that!111!!11!1!\" are just ignorant because it clearly states in the game desc that you \"... then transport your horse to the magical world of Star Stable Online! ...\" which costs Star Coins. It's self-explainatory, really. Anyways, I love the horses on this app, keep up the great work!! <3, UPDATE: even after contacting both google play and the star stable developer I STILL have not received a refund!!! DO NOT PURCHASE anything from this developer! Paid for full options, now the options aren't available anymore. I don't even know how to get a refund or get it fixed so i just paid 5.99 for absolutely nothing. NOT HAPPY. And yes I have tried contacting the developer., I love this! I just wish starstable was mobile as well, this game is lovely for starters! The horses are beautiful., I love the game so much because you can raise foals! And bing them to sso when thier level 10! But I wish their was an app version of sso because theirs probbly a lot of people that want to play sso but don't have computers or mac,pc. So is that to much to ask?, Very limited. In order to keep your horse & ride you must join their yearly membership. Which only seems to be on PC (my daughter doesn't own a PC). Graphics are nice, beyond that this is boring since you only train babies. I'll happily change my review if they add more to this app. Allow users to ride their trained horses. It doesn't have to be your full system but a limited like a sample., This is a well made game I believe that this game is not only uselfull it is also very entertaining as you can do tasks to level up your horse faster than how you would level up your horse in SSO. This games graphics aren't too bad but I've had some glitches during transfering my horses Otherwise this game is amazing💯, Parents, Don't waste your time. I installed this game to try and help my 4 year old daughter get a few horses since she only has the one she started with. After training the horse they wanted the equivalent of about $25 to move the horse to the online game PER HORSE. This game and the online version is an absolute rip off. Going to to find my child a new game to play., It's ok. But my requests are that you add more skins to all of the horses.And you make it where you can train the horses faster, I know this is good games but level up is so slow im waite few days and ride the horse, I love this game it helps me go through this struggling time. I've message Star Stable Online through YouTube there is only one thing that's disappointing me I would really like if you guys could do. I think that it would be great if you could add 3 new horses my three I was thinking was The new Jorvik Frieson I would love them. The next2 horse is a streach but maybe you could add the zonys or ayla/umbra. Add all patterns with friesian. Both zony patterns and magic forms of ayla and umbra TYSM❤️, This game is awsome but if you could add a riding part or riding events or somthing like that and could you get more stalls by leveling up not paying otherwise i love it, Really good to get horses u can't get in star stable. For people that are complaining that they can't get star stable, this game is mainly FOR star stable so your issue. It's amazing and not laggy at all, This is really fun now. My mum got me sso. Plz add marwaris and some other horses like that also when you transfer, it works. This game is good if your willing to buy a akahi teke, clydlesdale, irish cob and other breeds., I lov this app I love the new embermane horse maybe you can add a new horse in red like the blue and black horse that was limited and a update where you can ride your trained horses, I love it and I have friends and the real game itself also being a Star Rider but I have a issue. Every time I get on the game it does not let me play.j hope sso fixes it and I already reinstalled it and it still does the same, I love the game. It's really fun to play. The only thing I don't exactly like is the take care of the horse you have to be online but other than that I love the game, It is so amazing that u can put level 10 horses in star stable!! But the only thing that is bugging me about this app is that u have to buy stable boxes and themes., I'm giving this app a two star because the game is okay but when I go try to play sso it says I can only play on mac or pc i don't have either witch i was annoyed about so maybe you could change that so mobile and tabs can play as soon as possible but otherwise the game is good, I love this game but when it comes to transfering horses to SSO why is it so many Star Coins? Can't you lower the price a little? If you can't what's the point of buying horses here instead of buying them in SSO?, The reason is because there is 3 things. One, to get a nother horse other than 2 it costs money. Two, to get more options on food it costs money. And three I have a UMX phone and it just sucks that i cannot play SSO and if you do change it do not make it so you need to pay money. So if you do fix this i might recommend this gam other wise i hate this game. PLEASE JUST CHANGE THESE THINGS PPPLLLEEEAAASSSEEE, I love this game, but my horse gets really tired even when I first started this game. Can you please make them not that tierd so fast. Thank you because I love this game so much. 😍😍😍, I love how u can age up the horses and tranfer them to your account but i think the first horse u traing should be free or all horses should be free because i did both my hirses every day to level 10 and i only have 30 star couns i didnt kniw it was so much so PLEASE STAR STABLE JUST MAKE THE FIRST HORSE U TRAIN FREE PLEASE, This is an amazing game but I wish you wouldn't have to wait a full day so that you can level up.Is there anyway that you could cut down the time to 5-10 minutes, Best game ever! But to make it fun even more, daily star coins to be able to afford em? It' sucks cause we can't afford it!]

I'm not watching the ad for a booster again!!!!, easy, relaxing game to play if you are trying to kill time, Fun and cute. The Heroes totally rock!!!😻😻😽😽👩‍🚒👩‍🚒👩‍🚒, The app is good that ice cream, lemon........... All so cute it’s really nice app *Relaxing mind *But this app is like a *CANDY CRUSH* app *There is no life time for any levels *I think this app wants to little bit of devolpment., Love your game! When I get stuck usually can earn something to help. One problem on level 1348, says I need 4 honey pots and none on left on the board. What am I doing wrong? Thanks, I really enjoy playing this game but what happened to the three choice boxes before the game?!!? No more heroes to help on hard levels. And now I have to \"buy\" the boosters. The update sucks., Unobtrusive match-3 game, hardly any battery drainage, unlike others. This was my primary choice in choosing this game (38MB). Always bonuses and nice to play another game within this game. I really,really love this game. *An issue should be addressed: when I win 15 or 30 minutes free play,I shouldn't be losing lives. I started the game with 5 lives and won 15 minutes after losing one life. It notified me 15 mins were up yet, I only had 1 life left. Not Fair-plse fix this issue., Up until now 5 stars. Once I started having to wait for new episodes the game will not update on my tablet. It does on my PC but I like to play in bed before I go to sleep so not playing as much as I would like., It isn't as friendly as I would have thought. The game starts out making the player think, unlimited moves. Then by level 5 or 10, suddenly you are limited by number of moves. And money, well, let's see. First they want money for coins, then it's money to upgrade characters, then it's money for, what was it, clovers, I believe. The song, \"Money Greedy,\" comes to mind when I see all the things they want money for. I know these app developers need to make a buck but there is such a thing as greed., I absolutely love this slide match 3 game! The characters are adorable. It's game play is unique compared to other slide match 3 games. The different levels are refreshing and it's great in it's simplicity. When I start playing \"Candy Riddles\" I can't stop; that is until one of my sons or husband are hungry and need food! A CUTE game that I just love. This game deserved the 5 stars I gave it! Keep up wonderful job you're doing! 💛👍👍, I love it so far. But rewards need to be explained better. I used probably 6-900 coins after some levels bc I didn't know it was costing me my coins to tap to double the reward. Also...how about instead of giving 3 hours of free playing time all the time....give out some power ups. I must have enough free play time for the next 2 weeks. Its unreasonable to expect ppl to be okay with that reward all the time...bc no one is going to use it all--might as well be 20 hours. so mix it up. 💜, This is a very cute game. I like how interactive it is. My only problem is one that I run into in other games as well,this game plays ITSELF quite a bit. I find myself wanting to make moves,just when i think the chain reaction is complete and as soon as I lift my finger....\"DULP🤦🏼‍♀️\"the PRIOR move is STILL GOING. Otherwise I'd say 5 stars., I love the board characters in this game they're very different and interesting. Unfortunately the board play is rather slow and boring. Doesn't seem to be anything to encourage continued play. Definitely a bare-bones match 3 game. Would love to see some extras., I have really been enjoying this game. It was fun and relaxing until those pesky timer pieces showed up. I hate being rushed while playing. Having to rush while playing is stressful. I do appreciate the extra time bonuses I recieved as rewards. I purchased the 3-day unlimited play before winning the bonuses. Get rid of those bombs!, it's been one if my favorite games ever but for 3 days I can't get past level 630 because it won't give me enough red stars to complete the level, I wrote for support & can't even get an answer! Update, I have tried everyway to reach the admins & no answers in weeks I guess I'm wasting my time. I finally got an answer, it was my malfuction instead of the game's...I was at the point that I was trying to make myself uninstall the app, I'm so glad I didn't, it's by far one of my all times favorites!, i just started playing this game today and i luv it. i can't seem to stop playing it. great game lots of fun and extremely addictive. download and start playing now, and you'll fully understand what i'm ranting about... diffinatly worth the five (5) star's !*****, Don't think I'll be keeping this one... Barely enough moves or the pieces you need to get through the levels and the bonus stinginess is unfair just because I refuse to spend money on any game... If I want to deal with that kind of headache I'd play Candy Crush!!!! Nobody's original anymore, so sad!!, This looks like a little kids game, but dont be fooled. Unique, challenging and fun!!!! The hero's you collect through out the game, really help you pass levels.On the down side, most levels are the same, and that gets boring. Uninstalling., it doesn't give the coins or items for watching the videos and when the piggy bank pops up saying it is full and to purchase the game freezes and you have to close out of the game. fix these problems and it will be a good game. i don't have anything else running in the background., Cool, fun and exciting game. I think anyone would like it. If you like match 3 games. This one is fun and easy to play. It's does gets llittle more hard as u get to higher levels. That how it should be. Thanks for the game., Ive had this game for a while but 2day i played & had 195 coins when i came back to play i had 70? where did my 125 go? this is the 2nd time this happened & when i purchase more moves & go to play it takes my $$$ & starts me over from the beginning & i loose the lives/moves that ive purchased. i uodated 5/30/19 & i had to update again 2day 6/10/19? whats going on??? i love the game but im seriously thinking about uninstalling it unless you guys have a solution to my dilemma., I truly enjoy this game~~the more levels you get to is getting pretty challenging...I like it but the higher you get the harder it gets...really puts your mind so to speak to work overtime!!!! But your brain does need a good amount of challenge to focus correctly, to stay focused~~~I certainly know that~~~LOL!!!! 🍀🌟🐦🌞🦋⚛💫🌈🤩🌱💫☪️🍀🍀⚜⚜⚜✔✔✔, Love the beginning but I am elderly and play for fun. Wish they would stop upgrading me part way into it. Then I have to uninstall and start over., was enjoying this game till it would not let me buy any coins. then it never gives you enough donuts to feed the mice. what a shame to a fun game. hope it gets fixed soon., Well I truly loved playing this game before the recent update...now after EVERY match a stupid ad pops up and breaks my \"smooth\" playing experiance. Oh well , \"another one bites the dust\" !!!, this new update on 3/23/19 has completely ruined this experience for me! i feel that, i need to unistall! crazy ads popping up even when the app has been closed?! i loved this game, before today!!!, Love this game - never get bored, lots of variety to the games. I have run out of levels though, when are you adding more. completed 1900., i made purchased of Super Pack (Candy Riddles: Free Match 3 Puzzle) on 3rd Nov and have been deducted from my purchase credit i also got the confirmation by email but i don't received the pack yet. so please give me back my credit balance or just give the pack that i've been paid. !!!!!! or i will report this, Was great up until level 1456 and now unable to play, as it won't let you get past the notification to press skip and play the level. Please fix this bug., A very sweet game. It's a bit challenging which I appreciate. But still really enjoyable. Something I can't wait to come back and play., Love this game, just don't like having to wait for new episodes every week. still can't access updates from 12/02/19, I am a match 3 hound but this one if I could would give it a 10. Game is awesome I love it. Free lives you can win, hat's off to the developers just wish it said how many levels.. Please keep them coming..., Starts off great but becomes too difficult too soon ...even if you purchase powerups or extra moves. Takes all the fun out of it. Had to un-install, I💖 THIS GAME. But, it keeps cutting off my \"I 💖 RADIO \". I only play games that let me listen to my music while I play. 😢 Could you please fix ?, Love the game. Can be extremely aggravating at times. Just have yo put it up for awhile and then go back to it., It's a good game so far... I haven't had to pay any $$$ to pass a level yet. But I'm sure it will happen soon enough., Beautiful easy game to play. I do find this game relaxing and the graphics are excellent. I would recommend people to try t out, its good game. Cheers.!!!!!😁😇😎🍉🍐🌰🍄🌶🍍🌽🍎🍅🍋🧀🍈🍇🎄🎉🌎🇬🇭🇬🇪, One of my new favorite games, but why did you stop the interaction with the characters in the higher levels? That was the fun part!, A brilliant match 3 game. I can't wait until more levels are released. I've cleared all levels, just waiting for more., I like this game, enjoyable to play But it gets hard pretty fast. It's hard to keep getting 3 stars]

\ncom.budgestudios.googleplay.TransformersDisasterDash      [This app is very bad . You have to buy bots when you reach the SECOND WORLD !!!!! I bought 1 bot so that my kid could complete the SECOND WORLD . But then you need four bots to progress further . And at the beginning you only get two bots !! Please fix this ., Four levels? Required in app purchases to play more than the first level? Minimum purchase is $7.99 (US)? Surely this is just a big con that I fell for. I'm not opposed to spending money on games, developers work hard to make content and should be compensated for it. However, this is just robbery. My kid played through the whole game in about a day -- that's the makings of a $0.99 game, not the money that this one costs. The actual game play isn't that bad, nor is it unappealing graphically, but it's an unmitigated waste of money. If there were any way under the terms of use that I could request a refund, I surely would. Lesson learned for me, and here's hoping anyone reading this doesn't make the same mistake., The game becomes practically unplayable after a few levels without paying. And from what I see in some reviews, even after paying the game is finished in no time at all., As others have said... it's fun for your child until they get the level where they need three bots, and only get two for free. So suddenly a free game becomes a game that you have to pay for. If you want to avoid tantrums (or paying for worthless downloadable BS), don't download it., I love it but I do hope they make a verison where all the other bots are FREE and the game.every time i reinstall my game i dont start at the begining and i want to restart my progress, This locks content behind pay walls. Very early on the game becomes literally unplayable until you pay $8 per transformer or $16 for all of them. \"Free games\" are just a time consuming ads littered with other ads. Safe to all all or most games by this developer are like this., Yup cant even play some missions as you need 3 bots , if you want to buy more its 8bucks for one or 15 for all, Good, but it forces you to pay for characters so you can proceed with the game, Because my brother's trying to play this game and he doesn't have enough to defeat them more Bot you only have to he should have three I don't know how to defeat them more Bot but if you can please just give him one more robot, A money hungry game. You play basically one level and then need to pay to get another bot. Developers should hang their heads in shame with this blatant greed. Disgusting, It's a good game. Yes, you have to pay if want to continue playing with different autobots but it isn't that expensive considering. It's free initially but after that, of course you have to pay. I think it's worth it because my child plays it quite often and has yet to get super bored though I find it redundant. It's four levels, from what I noticed, that you can play with different Autobots. He's happy so it works for me., I hate this game because you have to pay real money! Why not game money. With game money more people will play. Then you could get five stars ratings., the only thind wrong is i think you need to be online to by autobots but nomatter what i absolutely my favorite game thank you budge studios for making this game i hope you make more transfomers rescue bots games i would like a transformers rescue bots roleplaying game������, Mega let down! My son loves the Rescue bots and I got the game for him to enjoy. going swimmingly until he completed the first level. Now I have to pay for more bots to play without another option to earn the bots. And he can't replay models. Now I have a very unhappy little boy because he can't play...seriously unfair people and underhand. To others - If you are not prepared to spend £5 don't buy this game., terribe game. would be zero stars except that's not an option. only two bots and first level free. cannot advance to any additional levels unless you pay for additional bots to unlock levels. each bot costs anywhere from $2 to $5 or more. not everyone has disposable income to shell out more and more money just so their kids can continue playing. way to pander to the rich, jerks., I dont mind paying to play, I get it, that's the purpose of these games. But, to lock out the level I just paid for, and then charge me another 4.99??? That's diiiiiiirty. My kid cant even play with the characters he just got. He was so excited to have OP and BumB on the same team. 5 minutes later, hes upset that he cant play with them anymore. Go ahead and vait folks to progress in the game by paying more, but dont deny access to what we have already paid for. Terrible...., Last time I tried this game I needed 3 bots but now I can only use 2 bots! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! I love this game it's better than any transformer game thanks!, Disappointed! My son loves playing this game. Thing is... I just purchased the Rescue bots package for him two days ago on February 21st for $5.99. My son only moved to the next level up; the bots LOCKED back up & now charging another $4.99. A waste of my money! Now my son is upset because he doesn't have his bots anymore. I CANNOT afford to keep paying into this game!, As they said it's not worth it when it's saying three bots please fix it so you will get 5 stars, My little five-year-old started playing. called me over wanted me to spend 8 bucks just to get a a new robot so he could continue playing .I said no mate they're trying to get you in. this is how these people trick you. be very careful of apps like this. Now my little 5 year old is more educated how the world works and realises that all you see is not as it seems. Deleted., DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless you want to pay money to not disappoint your kids. The game forces you to make a purchase after the first level because you start with two transformers and need three to continue. Each costs 2.99 or 4.99 for all of them. Not a lot a money but it shouldn't be advertised as FREE!, No educational value and you must buy to proceed. I don't mind buying games that have an educational value. This game will easily become boring and it's a waste of 4.99. Capitalism and generation of revenue is the lifeblood of all businesses but as a parent this game misses the mark as a good game for a kid. If you added math to it, I would buy it., Impossible to win for free you only get 2 characters and you have to pay 9.99 for all the characters and theres no decepticons the one rule of transformers instead it's with dr Morocco the only 2 good characters are optimus and bumblebee dont let your kid play, Can only get so far before you are required to purchase a robot to continue. No way to earn it for free, I don't recommend., My son can't even play past Mission 1 without payment for required bots?! He's 4 yrs old! Run some ads and make your money by allowing the option to view them rather than ripping off kids. Ridiculous. He's really sad and doesn't understand why I have to delete the game since he doesn't understand currency. THANKS! 👍, Very upsetting. My son was so excited for this game til it made it a requirement to buy more characters. Do not waste your time., Why do we have to pay for the fourth level?? If budge studios see this why don't you guys give us all the characters because It's 7.99 derhams for me and I don't want to pay that kinda money on just a game!!! Like who even does that dude!! That's why I give this app a 1 STAR OKAY BUDGE STUDIOS!! 😠😠😠, I Give this Game 4.3 Stars. 👍 Transformers Rescue Bots: Disaster Dash Game Pros: 💖Good Game Tutorial 💖Nice Game Control 💖It's better than similar games. 💖Good Game Smoothness 💖Clear Words. 👏 Thanks to Budge Studios ❤️ My Youtube Channel 👉 bettypvp, The thing is here is that the characters I can't buy them! This is why I hate the game cause! How am I! Suppose to finish the game if you can't get them in game! How about this new gamemode? 🤔 That the game is much fun the gamemode (this is the new mode I want) is with game cash so that you can get the other characters is it (a yes or no) answer it by the next few days to let you think about it okay👌& let me know if you agree gamers with the new mode? Is a Deal? 👌😋, Highway robbery!. Downloaded this for my kid and then saw the pay to play.. i get maybe $.99 for the upgrade but these fools want $8 just to finish the first levels. Get bent! Thanks for disappointing my kid. Scammers!, Worst game in the play store, my son came to me asking me to fix it for him only to realize you have to buy the bots to play the game... poor choice, way better games out there that are truly free... 10 out of 10 wouldn't recommend, Paid to unlock all characters and within days they were locked again. Some time later I though I would try again and paid to unlock all characters again. The app took my money but the characters did not unlock. Definitely do not recommend!, Not really free. You get only a couple of free worlds and then they force you to pay to continue. I Understand if you make it hard to play for free but not impossible to play for free. App was deleted., Can only play one level and then if you want to continue on, you have to purchase additional rescue bots. Very disappointing that there isn't a way to earn the bots. My boys were very upset to not be able to continue on in this game., please fix the controls on the second part of the tornado level. it is unresponsive. thank you problem has been resolved, and my son is happy. he says that it is awesome working with the autobots., My son loves being able to choose his team and at 4 years old gets very excited to pass levels and open up new adventures he also loves catching energon and switching into the different robot prototypes..to pay 4.99 to unlock all the characters is a cheap and easy upgrade to enjoy the whole team..., I would have gave you 5 star if you take some odf the money away. I am bored playing the same character over and over again. Every single game has money. Please atleast this or some other game, cancel money to purchase anything. 😭😠, Cannot play game for free (by design). Game requires you to select 3 characters but only gives you 2 to choose from. Don't waste your time only to let your kid down., Its not fair that after completing the volcanoe place you have to have 3 bots and you have to use actual cash to purchase!!!, UPDATE**** Issue resolved, rating updated. Thank you! Took my money but didnt give me any additional access. Emailed the designer listed and got no response. This needs fixed ASAP.]

collection, missing all money collection button or all stars collection button] [Ads: reasonable amount of ads] [Rewards: it doesn't matter how hard the request is, rewards are the same], These are things that I noticed on this game. I like this game, but these things need to be changed then everyone would benefit from it and you will get a higher rating than 5 stars. 1- You need to keep the currency for buildings the same and use gold for other instances. 2- One thing that annoys me is: You build 3 houses and factories? And then it comes on that you have more jobs than people, then the city planner tells you that you need more jobs. I don't believe so. Fix it!!!, Update: I will change my review once you have that kind of features cheers! I will play and love this game if the building can be upgraded and change the design when you upgrade, for example if I want to upgrade a house the looks of each level be different. Just like the Millionaire City before in Nokia game., Uninstalling this game, keep setting up businesses and homes but sadly losing so many towns people. Maybe if the lands weren't so expensive to purchase or the businesses or the houses maybe I could keep my towns people, but you've made that impossible. It's sad cause I was liking this game., Giving 1 star for the pop-ups timed to appear as you click sth else and force you to the App Store. Instead of downloading the ad's game, came here to rate Town City. Happy., Oh man, this is the game for anyone who likes building on a Sim level. Fun. Hours of entertainment. Easy to understand & play. Love it and have 4 running on my phone. More more more!, These my opinion about this game.. 1.I love this very much 💞💞but the ad always emerge...btw this game very fun it's suitable for people who love play city game..about the ad better you improve it quicklyyyy, The game is decent. The graphics are cute and colorful. But theres not enough \"stuff\". Theres only 3 or 4 buildings for the beach and so far no businesses for Leisurly Luxury island. Would be nice if there were more options for buildings. I also HATE that when you purchase a home with $$ it then changes to only being able to purchase with gold. And the lots are pretty expensive. It really forces you to purchase things. But, it passes the time and I like that you can move on to different islands, I enjoy playing because it is a clean game. You don't have to worry about not being able to move forward because your not paying to get the really good upgrades., Nice game; but typical *Pay to win* concept ; have to wait for hours if u dont buy money top up; even if u think u can make ur way by watching ads its not possible Precisely; a waste of time if u r looking for gaming experience, Please fix the bugs. I just upgrade house, about few minutes to be done. But suddenly the waiting turns im you 5 hours of waiting. What is going on? I was enjoying this game tho. But suddenly it came out error, The game is somewhat fun. It relies on the use of purchased gold to get things done rapidly. Earned gold could take years to accomplish anything useful. The annoying part, is after being stupid enough to purchase gold, the ads still pop up unexpectedly taking you to Google play to install more junk. Every game I have ever spent money on at least turns off the ads, but not this one. I will continue to play this game, though not with the same enthusiasm as when I first started., Such a poorly made game.. the graphic, concept, sound effect(music) are so childish ! At least the developers could try .. for now, this game is only for babies. uninstalled, and I don't recommend it, Superb game. I am so in love. This game is the key tool for any bidding politician at mayoral level or national politics level., Interesting game but you can't really get gold coins unless you buy with a credit card......and majority of buildings have to be purchased with gold., When I first saw this game I got excited, because it reminded me of the one I play on my PC, and this is for an Android tablet. However I became very discouraged when I realized this game gives you a five-second ad about every 2 or 3 minutes. Maybe it's 5. I watch ads on my own on the PC game and this one interrupts my play. So more than likely I will not continue to play, because it's a complete nuisance to have a five-second advertisement interrupt you every few minutes., i played this game before but after i log in again using my previous account, it say the building need to wait 274 days to construct. pls fix this because i really enjoyed this game, Really enjoying the game, I think the only thing that I would change is being able to rotate property's all the way round, I have questions for customer service and no one to talk to. The game should give more coins out weather in a spin whee watching movies etc.., Great game doesn't add bomb you all the time or slant the game. Just because they want you to purchase more bits for the game. Very even balanced game., Too few opportunities to earn gold and the gold earned are insufficient. How can you have islands without ports and you can't buy a port because you are not afforded the option of buying any sea property? I refer to frozen forest and versatile views. Also why do you change the currency in which people can buy houses and businesses? Keep to one standard currency please. In one day one is tasked to spend 1000 gold yet the maximum amount of gold earned at once is 100 after unlocking all islands., Fantastic game!!! Buildings look so neat and clean. We can zoom and see too. No challenges; so you can just build your city the way you want and enjoy it thoroughly as long as you can. Best part is no annoying ads to disturb you. Thank you!!!, Great at beginning but now earning gold has become impossible. What happened to the Discover Apps earing 1 gold???, I really like this game but it has some issues. The speed ups for X2 the profit and faster time in 15 min has stopped working. That's how I made my gold coins. Its extremely difficult to get the coins and it's also hard to get the money to buy land plots on the islands. I truly hope you can come up with other ways to be able to get more coins and money faster. I'm so far in the game I really don't want to quit, its disappointing when you have to play for weeks to get see any results, Love the game, but why is it so expensive to purchase land extentions, also homes and buildings , don't want to cancel game but it takes foe ever you expand land and build ?, This one is my favorite from Sparkling Society thus far. Love the graphics, the ample amount of islands, the functionality - you can earn money so fast. Earning gold is actually reasonable with this app! And of course continuous play offline. If only the City Island versions could get updates, to be on par with this one. Very pleased at present. *Excessive amount of exclamation notifications on the board btw. As you try to collect profits they seriously get in the way*, Congratulations Sparkling Society! You finally got it right! I've tried playing your simulation games for years now and it hasn't been all bad, but gave up because they ultimately had to many problems to be worth playing. I've been playing thus one for 2 days now and already see such a difference. The game is enjoyable and easy to play., Really great gameplay! I have a lot of fun with it. I havent had any problem with bugs or glitches, and it runs smoothly. Its addictive, a great time waister, and great for all ages. You can understand how to play if your young and its interesting enough to ppay when you're older. My only actual problem with the game is that it took a few tries to get it downloaded (im almost certain this was my phone's fault and not the game's) I really enjoyed it, I think most people do too., I love this game! So easy to build. Unlike other games, Town City gives enough coins to build up the town I look forward to working on my town everyday., I love this game! The graphics are superb and so detailed. Gameplay is easy, although I have to admit it took me a while to realise I could rotate the buildings. Duh! It's a long haul game that I find very relaxing. Yeah, gold takes a while to acquire but you can buy it if desired. It ran okay on my old Tab 3 to start with, but as the game advanced it couldn't cope, so bought a new tablet. Try it and see! I might just have to try some of the other island builders they offer..., Lot better than most city building games, tutorial was very straight forward, and then let you go free unlike so many others. I give thumbs up keep up good work. For gamers, after tutorial island there choice to keep building or continue story... I kind like the game its pretty easy to play unlike so many I have played where restrictions...so thank you developers make easy game to enjoy., Totally luv this game.....and believe it or not,its a game where i dont mind watching an ad...they're not forced upon u,like other games do....i seriously dont mind watching 2 ads at the most (only if u want to)1 ad to speed up the game process for 15mins..2nd ad is to double the outcome/profit from ur buildings for 15 mins....i do both everytime....i know free games like this make it from the ads that are shown ...but well done Sparkling Society,uv created another gud build game with a want for adverts.(i also play another of ur games).i no all free games make they're money from ads..but uv got it right ...oh there is the odd random ad thrown in every now n then..but nothing compared to other games...i just luv the benefits from ur ads...once again well done...👍👍👍, Loved it before update now it will take forever to earn enough money to buy anything and you will have to pay for gold to get anywhere. Also would be nice if you could move stuff to different islands and if there was a collect all. I deleted my other building game because I loved this one, but since update I am looking for new building game. Please undo update., You should be able to collect money when not playing. Collecting in a bank. Put a cap on it depending on how many banks and what level they are. Some places are 51M! NO way are you going to get to that point unless you have no life and play 24/7. Also, when you demolish a property or item, you should get maybe 85% of the cost back, also depending on level. Maybe an automatic collection of money during gameplay. Just a few suggestions., Full of bugs. One task was game speed. I already did click the game speed button and waited for 15mins. Well, it didn't count. Also, the gold coins are too expensive. I would rather buy gems for my mobile legends game than here. Also, logging in to the account keeps on asking to login. Oh before i forget, full of ads. One single click, 5-30secs ads. Omg!, Pretty good game. Very easy and laid back. I was looking for something like Cityville and this is okay. I wish there were missions that gave the game more purpose and challenge. I also really enjoyed how real the buildings in Cityville looked, it made you really WANT the buildings and you'd complete whatever you had to to get them. The buildings in this game are very colorful and cartoon like, so not really my jive. I do like that they periodically give you free tokens if you subscribe., game is nice and the graphics are great. the one thing that REALLY lets it down is that touching any building brings up a menu. so when you're trying to collect funds from the shops you inadvertently almost demolish buildings. this makes the game almost impossible to play on a phone. shame because i like it., UPDATE: as of today..sept 9th level 147 and my game has vanished. I am devistated!!!If you want to see an amazing layout...TaniaS1212 3 place local and 67th place global...600 days of play...my heart is broken. I uninstalled then re installed. My home island is full. All others are locked. My buildings on home island that are upgrading said 601 days to upgrade. ALL of my employees and citizens are still showing..over 23,000!! But has me at level 1 and my $5 plus billion is gone. 😥😣, I really loved this game a lot.many islands are there and we have to explore them it gives us an idea on how to set your house.adorable controls and the graphics are awesome than pubg .the editor us really amazing but the problem is as we built something directly the next level comes and more things to purchase and build you know that's the problem as per me .the ads are awesome as it has many deals and offers . love this game a lot truly and update this version I'll be the first to update.😌👩, Been loving to play this game for months but Im at level 56,, now it all crashed out and back to level 1. I cant recover my account even if i log in my hardwork is gone.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \ncom.freshgames.escapealcatraz                             [Not a great game. Story has been done to death, no real thinking involved in any of the puzzles, disruptive ads, and the final straw was the scissors part where i knew exactly what to do, used my one free hint to confirm what to do. And still couldn't get the damn game to do it no matter how I tapped. Bah. Not worth your headache., Was excited to play, but KEPT FREEZING every single time it started......uninstalled/reinstalled, STILL didn't work, I think it's a bug with ur music, as soon as it came on it would freeze, and even AFTER I closed it(AND removed from \"tabs\" screen), the music would STILL play....but EITHER WAY, music or not, u lost me before I even got to try, I suppose I'll check back later.....disappointing, Giving it 2 stars because it's a fun game, but so frustrating to play and even if you pay for the answers, those are hardly answers. Lots of bugs in the game too where you just have to get out of the game to keep playing and this is with good Internet and a Samsung ultra s 20, This game is awesome except when I got up to the part where you had to get the tiny metal balls in the holes inside the accordion, some of the balls glitched outside of the accordion then I couldn't progress to the next part and I'm still stuck on that part but overall the game deserves a 5 star rating., Would have been a good game but was over way too quick and you have to pay to play I didn't mind paying 2 euro but I was shocked when it was over so quick a waste of money, Can't progress past the point with the accordion balls. The keep spawning outside the bit with the holes. wast of money., The balancing level, which is like three minutes into gameplay, is absolutely horrendous. Took me about 50 tries and it's not an issue with my phones sensor. Kept shooting off the right side no matter how much I leaned away from it. Lame. But, overall a fun game. Somethings wrong with that bit for sure though. I only got past it by sheer luck., Great puzzles good story line well thought out only one thing your library puzzle was difficult because I didn't have maths skills and little spelling I never leant much at school so in future consider people without education my wife good at spelling and mathematics hope this helps, Out of the ordinary, good challenging puzzles, but worth the clues/answers. Recommended. RonB, The game loads the title screen and plays the music and that is all. Such a shame. Using a Samsung Galaxy S8., The puzzles are sometimes unclear and I've had a few glitches where it should have worked and it just didn't register but still fun, I was enjoying the game and then all of a sudden it just stopped progressing. Not glitched, Not froze, just stopped. You can still hear environmental sounds but there's nothing on screen & if you back out it starts the game over. Damn, that sucks. Could've been a 4 or 5 star!! 2/5, Game is very nice but the promotional approches are very bad because they make us compulsary to buy a hints otherwise game doesn't continue, Graphics are okay but some amof the levels are very slowish and boring as well as confusing , other levels are ok I give props for trying to be a different type of escape game but I feel the need to escape this game because free to play DON'T MEAN pay to play lose people this way even if I wanted to keep playing and pay I wouldn't because this company is false advertising which is not OK., I have completed the game within a day some time it is hard and sometimes it is easy, i give 3 star's because sometimes it doesn't work properly, Overall the game's nice..but.. because of the librarian level I hate this game.. cause that level is almost impossible to complete without some hints... meanwhile.. They'll make us to use the hints many times before reaching the librarian level..I got stuck in the level...so I just uninstalled it....rest is fine about the game, Personally, I had an amazing experience. Some of the puzzles really get you thinking, and I really like the concept. I really like this game!, It a nice gameplay.....its also has hard levels which is good for our mind and sametimes bad too.....this gameplay has really helped me in other ways.......actually there is only one problem which is there is no videos for the hints......this is a issue that i have hope it will be fixed soon.....thanks, Can't get past level 2 once I complete the puzzle nothing happens, and when I use a hint it just gives me the same one every timeI think it would be a fun game if I could get past this gosh darn level,but the only reason I'm not getting past this level is because nothing happens after I've solved it and it's not letting me move, Game is fun but there is a glitch that keeps happening between screen and level changes where the screen goes black and the only remedy is to close the game and reopen. This happens constantly while playing :( If this is fixed I'd happily give more stars!, The game is interesting and nice. It needs to have hints if you get stuck somewhere. I just uninstalled the game because I got stuck at a stage and I Wanted a hint which I couldn't get., Complete trash. Easy puzzles. Dreadful graphics. Painfully slow screen transitions. Also when trying to 'unlock' full game takes you to a scam site and doesn't honor completed 'deals'., Okay this game desereves one star, after 15 minutes of playing it stopped me on the \"Lights out air vent level\" it says that i need to purchase or complete an offer to continue playing, seriously i have never seen such way to force players to pay, worst game, This game is so fun! During this pandemic I find myself bored and I start playing this the only bad thing about this it's the leaning and balancing part, It's impossible to get past the level where you have to carry the supplies to the cells. The hint tells you to lean and balance but doesnt elaborate on how to do that. I was left tapping and swiping around uselessly before ultimately rage quitting., I thought this was a good game but got no hints when needed.. I need hints if I want to play the game. I have to pay cash if I want to get clues. I am not ready to buy clues by paying cash. So I've been reviewing it badly if it's not updated to get the exact hints, Nice game but I don't know why I am getting stuck after I open the ventilator. It's always showing that I have to buy hints. If the developer informs me why this is happening then I'll be very grateful, F- Game gets stuck in ads when u exit ad game goes back to main menu Then you start the game again and the ad starts, then it exits to main menu again CANNOT PLAY THE GAME Also I don't like the nasty ads with people in bed together F-, Great game but the first time I played it I was stuck for like an hour trying to find one final thing until I finally fawnd it and then I still can't get it because it was in the corner where the icons are but it's hard but Great, It wont start.. The game just freezes. Was hella excited, all in vain. Here's your 1 star, It stopped for no reason and wouldn't go any further. I restarted it and it did it again. Waste of a download., Got past first level. Needed to complete offers to continue. Completed offer and still couldn't continue without buying full game. Also too slow paced on loading screens etc, There should be a review number range in the negative spectrum of integers to sufficiently rate this less than zero money grab attempt. You have no shame or guilt. Trash. Trash. Trash. Trash. Trash. You spent time and energy developing Trash instead of attempting to make a one star game. You figured out a formula and dragged what should be an art form straight into the gutter. You are the Santa Claus that smells like liquor and drives an old creepy van with curtains. Trash., I paid money to play the game still shows ads which is insane. A yatzee ad keeps freezing the game up and will not let me go any further no matter what I try., Creative gameplay and cool art, but the game pretty much holds your hand the entire time. The puzzles are rather boring. Then, just as you're avout to escape, the game prompts you to pay to continue or gives you a \"free\" option. The free option requires you to \"complete an offer\" of your choice to continue. But this is NOT FREE. Free means one-way. Free means nothing in return. Giving my information up to a survey site or downloading an app might not cost me money, but neither is really \"free.\", So bad that the game developers make us play other games inbetween and earn the complete game...isn't it too much?? Or else if anyone is frustrated he/she can spend money and buy the full game...I mean common why can't you mention this at the start itself. Pity on you. Never download it., It was an ok game until I reached the payment choice. I wasn't sure if I wanted to pay for a game that was just \"ok\", so I tried the option of downloading one other game and do the achievement, but after 4 days that took me to complete, I couldn't continue Alcatraz, no idea why. It just doesn't accept it that I completed the task. Anyway, after reading a lot of reviews to find a solution (I didn't btw), I think that I shouldn't support that app. There are better escape apps for free/watch adds, Garbage game, it just freezes up. Don't even waste your time downloading it., The gameplay is decent enough so I'm giving two stars, but up to a point I was going to give five. This developer uses the classic strategy of waiting until you've played a fair amount of the game and then blocking you behind a paywall. Alternatively you can fill out few surveys... or so they claim. I jumped through the hoops but it was just another link taking you to the next survey and then the next seemingly forever. Unless you plan on buying it, don't waste your time., Great game but Completely ruined by the half way survey/purchase required to continue.]

The brushes are simple, color, rulers and layout in general. I've used it since I first started drawing digitally, which was what-? I can't even remember how long ago!! I have no complaints, how ever, one suggestion. Please let us sign in with more than Twitter :). It would help a lot :D. Overall, perfect app. 10/10 would recommend., It's an amzing app. I can use it for all my drawingd and it's easy to use. I would and have recommended this to people. But there is just one draw back. This is the fact that i cannot import photos onto a canvas. I do not know why but one morning i had just gone on and it wouldnt let me import then it would crash after trying to load. Very annoying, any way to fix this?? I have already deleted and redownloaded :/, Its becoming irritating.. So I've been using this app for years now, lately its becoming harder to import photos from your gallery. Whenever I try to add a picture to my canvas, it crashes and lags out. I even took the time out of my day to uninstall the app and re-install it. It still doesn't work!! Please fix this, its starting to piss me off even more., I attempted to use Ibis Paint a few times beforehand and didn't even really give it a genuine try. I gave it a genuine try and now I want it to be my main drawing program on my tablet. The brushes are so crisp and clean its blowing my mind. Also it's got a ton of features and textures. I had to buy the version without ads though, kinda couldn't stand them. Personal preference, though., I find it really easy to use and this is the best app I've used so far however I'll have to remove a star because everytime I try to draw something it lags really badly I've tried updating it and it did nothing. Please fix it and I'll add another star. Other than that the app works great and there are plenty of brushes to use. I really recommend it, but if ads are something that bothers you than this app may not be the best for you. It is good but it has way to many ads., A great app, lots of brushes to use, but the only problem is, when you first start, it gets quite confusing (before the tutorial starts anyway). I gave it 5 stars though because you get used to it as you play more. No ads (so far). I've only just got started but as far as I am concerned, this is a nice app to use when you are a beginner or a talented artist., This app is nice,I've used it for 4 years now. But there are some issues that occure sometimes. When I want to import an image,my screen just goes black and does nothing. It's not the first time that this happened but I don't really kno what to do. I stopped using ibis for a while then when I used it again,it worked. So i don't know a proper solution., Ibis Paint X is as good as they come. It's the second drawing app I've ever used that I actually loved, the first being ArtBoard. However, there is one thing that ArtBoard has that Ibis could benefit from. A color mixer! You take two colors, and you can blend them together by moving your finger in a circle. Depending on the direction, you add more of color 1 or 2. It's useful for finding colors, making gradients, and shading!, Hello, I really like this app but for some reason once a draw something it won't let me draw over it and I literally drew it like 3 seconds ago I am not sure why it does that but it would help a whole bunch if it was fixed, also one more thing sometimes when I draw it sends me back to the home page and I think I saw a few other revews about that so I don't thinks it my internet. Thank you for taking your time to read this and if these were fixed I would so happy.😃, This is a great app! I can use it for edits and lots of other stuff! The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because it makes you watch adds for certain brushes,which gets a bit annoying 😥. But in their defense they were trying the art experience easy so the app doesn't give you adds mid-drawing, so they had to add ads somewhere I suppose. But anyways I think its a very good app! I Would recommend!, This app is absolutely amazing but the thing I find annoying and really hate is that it doesn't save you're drawings... Like if you delete the app for a little while and download it back, ALL YOUR ART WORK IS GONE. It's so frustrating to have your hard work GONE, I really hate that and I hope that this change. PLEASE fix this and I'm surprised this issue haven't been fixed., This app is great. I've been using it for years with no problem at all, but one occurred today. I cannot import images at all. I've tried re-installing the app, restarting my device and made sure I had heaps of free room. I don't know if this is the app or my tablet but when U try to import an image, the app closes. If anyone knows how to resolve this issue, please let me know!, The app is Amazing, you don't really need to pay which is a good thing. I'd recommend this to new newbies, it has variety. I would like to see more apps, I'm kinda thinking of an animating app that includes Ibis Paint. The reason is I wanna make animations, but most apps you need to buy. Which makes me lazy, I really want many features like Ibis Paint, and If you do make like an animating app that's has an Ibis Paint crossover thingy. I'm sure it's gonna blow up if you put quality. Ty again, This app is really amazing! I enjoy drawing on it and just doing random doodles. Its easy to use and learn on. Best free app I've tried so far. The reason I gave this app 3 ☆, is because of some bugs. While drawing the app would glitch out and my earased lines would reappear. Another glitch is that when I try to hide a layer it would go on and off. And the most dissapointing glitch was when I was working hard on an almost done drawing when it glitches and disappears. Please fix this. 😭, Its good and all, but why won't it let me import pictures anymore? It was working just fine until the next day, I have an android so when I try to import it, it opens the files app and let's me select the picture I want. but it won't do that anymore. It kicks me out each time I try to import a picture, is there any reason for this?-, This app helped me a LOT to make my avatar and every different drawing I wanted (and wasn't able to) draw on paper! I love this app 10/10! If you want to get an app that is easy to use and doesn't necessarily require any skill then this is the ideal one, it has everything from dip pens to paint brushes, and it's just amazing! 😀😁🤩, Easy to use once you get used to it. I downloaded it last night and I've already done 2 drawings, both of which are the best I've ever done. The stabilizer is amazing (I think that's what it's called). The only problem I have is there's no way (that I can find) to turn something you've selected to a cirtain degree. I'm giving it 5 stars, just in case I haven't found it yet. Amazing app., lt's great! Theres many features, brushes, and just an amazing app in general. Though, when you to use the drawing app for a while it starts to be very laggy and sometimes even crash, l don't mind it much though because it auto-saves my art. 18 hours for the premium brushes after watching ad(s) for 'em is honestly a perfect amount of time! 10/10 l highly reccomend 💙, Basically it is just drawing, but once you delete all of your progress, they are gone forever, there is no retrieving it back, so i would say it would be helpful to add the Button in the setting called ( Retrieve Old Progress ) Basically it would bring back your old progress, even if your on guest. So please add this feature so we wont be stressed, Ibis Paint is my favourite drawing app. There are so many different tools and abilities this app has that I still do not know of, but I'm anxious to learn more! My drawing skills have improved much since I used this app. I also use this magnificent app for editing/redrawing photos. I do not use Ibis Paint for work, I just use it for fun, and to get better at drawing anime. Not there yet that's for sure though! I recommend this app to any anime artists, or just for entertainment you'll love., This app is really it, I use it all the time to draw my lineart, but the best of all is that they also have tutorial videos so you can learn how to draw certain things on their youtube channel, and inside the app. You also don't have to pay to use all the brushes, you just have to watch one ad and then you can use all the brushes for free. The gap recognition needs a bit of work. It fills half of the lineart i'm trying to color, but sometimes it goes outside the lines. Good app overall., I love this app! I have so much fun on it, when I'm grounded from my games like Gacha club and texting story, I listen to music and draw. I have a few complaints though... Every time I'm drawing like a line and trying to be careful with it, it thinks I want the color I'm drawing over, And I Don't really know how to draw a anime character so it would be REALLY helpful for me if you add a tutorial for drawing anime characters in the drawing space thing. Thank you creators of Ibis paint x for this, this app is great! I've been using it for almost two years and I haven't had any complaint about it. But the past weeks I can't really use it cause it works too slowly for me and sometimes it just crashes and then close by itself. My problem is that because of it working too slowly I can't make anything, please help me somehow. I can't do anything, The best app ever! Has amazing brushes, you don't need to buy all fo the brushes all you need to do is watch an add and you get all the brushes for free for 18 hours, I use this to create thumbnails for my videos, art for memes, easy edits it's so fun, it is really easy to use and it has a really helpful tutorial! I definitely recommend!, I like the app it has a wide variety of brushes,backrounds,etc there's just so much they have that I can't name them all I definitely recommend you check It out I'm sure it will be your favorite drawing app the only thing I wish was there was that we could make the canvas longer but you still can make it pretty long so don't make that stop you from downloading it. Some features are locked but you can get premium or have to watch one add every 18 hours and almost every feature is unlocked. Get it, This app is amazing. It has hundreds of brushes and it let's you use layers! I've been using ibis for two years now, yes my phone has reset before and I did lose my art but it's on me because I didn't have an account attached to it. In the years I've used ibis I still dont know what every thing does like the alpha lock, but that's just for me to discover, I LOVE IBIS PAINT X!!! This app is my go-to drawing app. It is not a difficult site, like Krita, beacause Krita has too many tools and is hard to use. ibis Paint X is a very easy to use program. This is also a kid-friendly program!! Kids like me would totally love this app. It has many optoins of brushes and I LOVE the new \"Special\" Tool update. It truly is special!! It has a liquify tool (dragging tool), smoothing tool, expand and shrink tool, etc. It truly is just a wonderful app for all ages., I haven't done much work with full on super advanced art, but as an \"everything\" photo editor it works great. I can easily design a whole advanced Youtube thumbnail with a mix of this and Snapseed for the focusing tool. The only thing I wish this had was a healing tool, but this is an art app not a photo editor. I honestly wish there was a desktop version of this app, I would give it 5 stars if it doesn't show up a black screen when i want to import an image, come on, it's like the 5th time. Maybe it's just my own device, but if this could be fixed, I'm sure giving it 5 stars. I currently can't draw for a long time now, it takes alot of time to put ibis paint normally. When my storage is full, I literally have to uninstall Ibis Paint first., the Magic Wand and the Paint Bucket needs to be fixed. Ive had this app for years and i really love it, but the Magic wand and the Paint Bucket is literally broken for months, whenever i used the Paint Bucket..some of my drawing will be gone or distorted..same for the Magic wand (if i use it many times) so i have to restart and restart and restart the drawing and its tiring me, i also noticed that its not just me that have this problem. Please fix this bug or glitch, its annoying and tiring., Ibis paint is a lovely app, I have had a grand experience! It's so easy, and fun! Usually when I am confused on an app, I would search up how to use it, and this game was a little confusing at first, but after playing around with it for atleast 20 minutes, I was able to use it easily! I was a very bad artist a few years ago, but once I got this app, my art got better and better from the day! Highly recommending this app! 🤩🤩🤩, I give four stars! Amazing app, but, sometimes when i click on the \"Import Picture\", i select an image but then disappear. I hope you can solve this problem. Thank you! I wanted to Give four stars because it's really amazing!You can do whatever you want, and i like that i can draw 3D, sorry if i spell some word wrong but i am a child and i am from italy. Have a nice day!, Update: This is still the best free paint program. However, I have to report that the program crashes now every time I try to import a photo. I hope someone can please fix this. Thanks again for your amazing app. ----- Best ever and free. Thank you guys so much for making this available. The new features are beyond amazing!, This is an easy 4 stars I had to take away 1 star because of the tutorial i uninstalled a week ago and download it again today the tutorial parts keep popping up on the middle of the screen and it's really anoying. However there is not to many adds and I like how you can just watch an add to unlock everything for 2 days and you can keep doing that. I highly recommend downloading this app it's a great help!, It is great! I would recommend if your bad at drawing and you can make so many colors!I LOVE it but the only reason I give it 4 star is because just something's is difficult to do so maybe u can make things a little easier but not to easy i still love a challenge but I would definitely recommend if you love drawing but just not good at it and you can draw anything you heart wants but thank you for this game it is amazing and pls make more games like this in the future,I love this app!, Best drawing app for phone!! Complete features, interesting filters, easy to customize tools, variation of how to save your drawing (it even autosaves your speed-drawing~ Export it to mp4 and you get a speed-drawing of your piece)! Also, it gives you a starting-tutorial (So don't just click ok without reading each of them~👀) It might be confusing at first (for there are so many things you can try🙌), but I promise it'll be fun once you're getting used of it!! Immaculate🥰💯, It's the best drawing app and the most affordable! it has helped me grow as an artist and i'm very grateful about it, but i have some issues, Once i add more layers to my drawings some dots start to appear on them, which makes them appear bad quality, please i'd be happy if you fix this., Very well made app, I have been using it for around 4 years and overall it's a really good art app. It took a bit to get used to the mechanisms and different brushes/filters, but that's a given for any art app. I would highly recommend to beginners and advanced because of how good and easy to use it is., This is great and i totaly reccomend it although there are some weird things about the app..whenever i try to import a picture it always error and im not sure why.ibispaint developer,if by any chance you see this,please fix the bug. Update:okay,so i tried re-installing the app and seems like its working again soooo, if you happen to have a bug like that just uninstall and re-installit:DD, This drawing app is amazing very,enjoyable and usefull! and I really hope this app get more updates to come! .But there is a problem about quality's of images it gets low resolution after saving into a -Png/J.peg- .Please make the quality more better and detailed and please can you make the brushes more dynamic when moving. I hope this app get more better and more updates to come!]</td>\n      <td>jp.ne.ibis.ibispaintx.app</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>com.canva.editor</th>\n      <td>Canva: Graphic Design, Video, Invite &amp; Logo Maker</td>\n      <td>&lt;b&gt;Canva makes design and video editing amazingly simple (and fun)!&lt;/b&gt; 🙌 Create stunning Christmas cards, Holiday wallpapers, and New Year greetings with your photos and videos—even if you’re not a design expert!\\r\\n\\r\\nA versatile free graphic design app: full editor, Instagram story maker, video maker, video collage creator, logo maker and poster maker, book creator &amp; mood board creator — Canva is the ultimate editing app.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesign your Instagram Highlight cover, Instagram Story or no crop posts, create a logo and banner for social networks: Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter.

I have only one problem, rather it's a suggestion. I'm a free user and I find the interface a little irritating. The free and premium elements/photos are mixed and it becomes irritating after a while of scrolling. It'll be really amazing if it has a feature of sorting between free and premium one so it'll be easy to have all the free elements in one place for us free version users., Loved this app until it updated. It is less user friendly for many reasons. Previously when picking a canvas I could see a visual and now only the dimensions. Another thing is when adding items such as stickers the options now completely block the project you are working on. I want to be able to see my options to add and see what I already have. The simplicity that made me love the app is no more. I am frustrated and disappointed with the update., Love the new features being added like the format painter and the color picker, but I'm not sure what has happened with the all around functionality. The mobile app is almost useless. I have to \"guess\" on the alignment and sizing of my designs before posting. I end up editing the same file several times just to get what I am seeing on my screen to reflect what is actually saved and downloaded. What is going on? It also keeps freezing the editor because it can't sync up. Help!, Was considering upgrading to the pro version, having remembered it only cost $4/month, but now seeing they raised the monthly rate to $13 dollars... No thank you! I already have an Adobe cloud subscription for all their apps, not worth the money. I can justify $4 a month just to have something for \"ease of use,\" when I don't feel like starting a project in Photoshop, but not the $13., This app works decent for as it is intended, however it's expensive. Even after paying for the premium service there were times when we were asked to pay more for certain decals. We also cancelled the service twice, and they continued to charge us after we cancelled. We didnt find out until we were combing through credit card statements., I really really hate the new version. The old one worked great and I could design something for my business in under 10 mins and have it posted but this new version is absolutely terrible and really laggy. The features are weird and don't work the way the used to and I get so frustrated I'm contemplating ending my membership. Please fix this., The update is the worst! I couldn't even overlay more than 2 photos - it will suddenly turn blank, the quality of photos for FREE USERS got LOWER. When typing text, the project suddenly became so small that I couldn't even see a thing. A side from that the whole app became looks too basic, it almost looks like PICSART! The new design and function of this app is too hard to use. If I could give a ZERO RATING for this app, I will! Now I couldn't even edit my designs., I am a daily user of canva and just love this app for its ease of use, but the latest update is just not working for me. Its cumbersome, not easy to use at all, the adding images from gallery is also not working as it used to earlier. Also other options that were so simple to work on seem complicated now. Didn't like this update at all., @ Canva Dec team. I love your app, i use your website a lot so the recent app updates with added editing features was easy for me to adjust to-thank you for that by the way! The problem I have now is when I save my work and download it, the result is not identical to my work in-app. The text placement is wrong, images have moved, etc. This is devastating as I have no way of fixing this once saved and downloaded. I hope you can fix this issue soon as I love using Canva, but as is I cannot use., Disappointed with the latest update- possible bug? I recently created a brand new design on the PC, then went to use the app to download a copy to my phone, but for whatever reason, it says (even though I have the latest update) that the app needs to be updated before I can do anything besides view it. It won't let me download it or anything. It's a little frustrating, but otherwise, the app does what I need it to do., I cannot get this app to work on my Android tablet. It works fine on my iPhone... I've had it installed on my phone for about 2 years so I don't know if it's because of this update that I keep reading about or not. On my tablet I can't get past the white screen with the teal Circle that says canva. Does anyone know how to fix this? I've already uninstalled and reinstalled twice. I've also tried to force stop. Nothing is working., Dear Canva, I kindly request you to change the structure of Canva and keep it just like before for the mobile version. It is looking too confusing and selecting and editing has become very difficult now. The selection of image, fonts and everything has become way complicated. I love your app, but this is my heartfelt request. Please make it easy, I use the free option. There are lots of great elements. I'd like to thank Canva for reaching out with options. Whether there's been a new update or what I did, the app is working again. This is one of my go to Apps. I do wish when searching you could search better for paid/pro items and free items. It might be an option on desktop, but not mobile. I have not checked. I highly recommend this app., This app is absolutely incredible, it really allows me to express my creativity and the full extent of myself within the content that I make. The tools and options that I have in This application are absolutely phenomenal and they are amazing to use! I highly recommend this for beginners and advanced users!, besides, I like the front view and can see more template options, elements, etc. I am having a hard time after updating recently, because the final result of the design after saving is messy and untidy, so it takes a long time if the editing process uses a smartphone. I prefer the previous version. I would prefer it if adjusted as in the beginning. Thankyou, Canva on mobile is so hard to use. Update: Some features are now available in the app and is now \"somewhat\" easy to use. New concern: the app says i need to update for me to access the design I created using the web interface. I updated the app but the app will still ask me to update. Not changing the rating because of this., My review of Canva after using it for almost 3 years. Canva is undoubtedly the market leader in the online DIY image and graphic design tool. Canva is a great tool to create attractive visuals, and for people like me, it is an excellent replacement to Photoshop as well. But generally, it is not an image editing tool like Photoshop. I am a freelance beauty blogger and writer. Hence, with my limited capabilities and need for graphics editing, it is an excellent substitute to Adobe Photoshop., Honestly the App was incredible before this last update. I just saw I had another update and secretly hoped they were reverting it back some how. I have to do everything on my lap top now which doesn't obviously work due to images being on my phone. Used to take a couple of minutes. Now takes ages. Even just to open it. Pretty disappointing. Legit best editting and self-marketing tool out there. Just this update.... damn, Oh my, they just gave us a new update and it's horrible. The UX is sooooo bad, not user friendly, to many steps just to edit one single element, and boy the result won't be the same as designed. I'm going back to photoshop..thanks., I love using Canva. It is so easy to learn and fun putting pieces together. The one thing I would like to see improved is the sensitivity of the app when switching in and out of zoom views. I have a touchscreen laptop and I use the touchscreen sometimes but the proportions either get super tiny or super large if I'm moving too fast. Other than this, I love it., I am facing challenge while editing any Designs on Canva thru my cellphone app. I have Samsung Galaxy A8 Star and after updating my app, the alignment of the design goes for a toss. The issue persists after reinstallation as well. It works well on web but its always workable doing it on mobile but currently its defeating the purpose.., Major upgrade from Vistaprint. Mobile friendly app, super user friendly modification to designs. Love it. I do all the advertising materials for our small non profit and even printing through them is 1/3 the cost of any other option ive found. Definitely recommend and wish I'd found it sooner., Difficulty to use. You have to brainstorming to understand how the application animation works. It will makes you to consume so much time just to create animated logo. It suddenly crop picture when moving it. no text color setting. Limited choice of text effect color. Not recommended to use, Made a post with multiple lines of text. I can't freely select text &amp; a particular line is shown as massively large than the rest. I make the changes, font etc are same as rest of the text. Then I use the web version, realise changes have been made properly &amp; no text large issue., Excellent app. Friends this app is very user friendly. Once you know how to use it you will be able to design any kind of poster or logo you are looking for. Now no need to go to a cyber cafe or graphic designer to get your logo done., This app was great until the update. It was so much better to navigate through things and bring creations to life. It doesn't seem to have the same mobile capability as before. Just as others have said,, I too create things and after viewing them in my phone gallery,, everything is all out of place. Like the saying goes if it's not broke don't fix it. I am very irritated with the new way! Bring the previous way back!!!!, This app used to be good, but now when I add animations, the size of the texts become smaller and move to the corner whenever I play it. However everything is normal without animation. I don't know why, because it used to work, I used to give 4 stars, before the new update. Seriously regret this. Could you just add another things without changing how it's work before? I spent a lot of time editting, struggling with the new navigation pane. End up, when i downloaded the images, they're totally different than my design. You waste my time. Please convert it like before or else I'll just uninstall this non-functional design app., Canva makes my post look so much more professional! I love that there are so many options! The one complaint I would have is for there to be a bigger representation of Black Men, Women, &amp; Children! Overall this is a great tool!, Update: Browsing my local files is very slow (loading) and glitchy. When I delete some files from my gallery to once again browse them through the app, not all files show up. Initial review: Not a fan of the new update. I can't replace an element with a solid color anymore (which I use as a placeholder for content to add in the future)., I love the previous version. This new version is totally a mess. Everything messed up. When I download either to JPG or PDF, every font &amp; element size change automatically. As the result, it turns to something really different with my original design :( :( :( I used my android phone. But it works well on my pc. Unfortunately it's really not convenient if I have to use it on my pc only. I prefer to designing on my phone. Please fix it!, I really do not appreciate the current UI of the app. It is more PC/laptop friendly rather than it being mobile friendly. It's so difficult to be able to navigate around and there are so many features that are not there any more. It's become difficult to locate and edit images and videos. Really upset on the recent update and UI., This app was almost perfect on a phone. Quite buggy online but the phone app was so much better. Until it just updated, I will leave it installed on my phone for a few months but unless it changes will not use it again, so glad I never paid for it. What a disappointment, I just don't understand how you can take a great app, and update it to something that is almost unusable. Simple example, how do I rename something I have created? I'm searching for an alternative now., So Heartbroken After The Update. Same issues as everyone else. I used this app EVERYDAY for my business. I could swoop in create something awesome in 2 seconds and be done. Now I can barely use it. No matter what I save, its completely messed up and not formatted correctly when I post it to social media. Adding text I can't use my spacebar. Takes forever to move or reposition items. I was about to purchase Pro but now I can't use the app. Please allow us to have the old version back!?!?, Awesome app. Helps me prepare presentations, design simple stuff and whole bunch of things all for free. Planning to switch to premium soon. Totally worth it. Also need to mention that it might crash if your device isn't very strong, Canva Pro is a valuable accept for small businesses who cannot afford to fit creative website design into their budget. and Canva is also a great app that can be used for earning a decent side income by creating templates for advertising and promotional pages that are in social media format. Canva can also be used to make animated videos, business cards, brochures, logos, and other types of creative's. I give this app a full five stars. Oh and I almost forgot pro members can invite 4 friends., WAS good, now it looks like they're trying to bring the desktop UI/experience to mobile which renders the whole point of getting an app useless; Text blocks constantly resize and its an extreme hassle to even delete the \"lorum ipsum\". I was excited to see it was renovated until I started using it. I'll just go back to the version on my laptop Edit: Uninstalling the app from my phone. It's no longer functional on an S20 ultra which is beyond me. I'll be going back to the desktop version., Latest update sucks!! All my previous designs have had the formatting thrown out of whack. It's laggy, glitchy, freezes, reverts back to home page without prompting. The designs home page doesn't show the latest designs, and are 'stuck' mid edit. Horrible! Fix the latest update bugs and it's a brilliant, addictive, and easy to use app. One of my favourites prior to the latest update., First review was *****. Now, though, after the most recent update, I can't use it on my S20 Ultra. The image it saves is not the image I've created, the text runs off the screen with no way to adjust it. I really hope another update is pushed through fast! Update: The new update made things marginally better, and I was able to create a beautiful instagram post. However, when uploaded to instagram, the text is sacrificed up in one area of the image and it doesn't look at all like what I'd made., When I opened the app on my tablet one day, I couldn't add or make new designs anymore. So now, I have to either edit my old designs to make new ones, or use and edit templates. It's frustrating. I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this, but I hope this can be fixed. Also, I tried making a design on my laptop using the website, and was annoyed to find out that I can't download designs on there unless I pay for Canva Pro.

It has sooo many colors to chose from and I love how when you draw something it draws it on all the sides and it has no adds at all hopefully I will study because I'm playing and playing all the time I am turning dum this game is great I love it I am adictid to it I'm just stuck to it I talk TOO MUCH so I'm going to stop but I still have a lot more to say Download this game now on play store gosh I'm done ill continue my art masterpiece. BYE, I love the app but the ads are getting a little annoying and every time I try to make a things it always goes straight to the video and I'm not even pressing anything but I figured out how to fix it. I am very happy with the app I hope this is helpful if you're even reading this long of a paragraph., This app is the best! Whoever made this app has a unique way to think of art. This is verry cool. I love how many options and how easy it is to draw on this app. Its not to complicated. There is one prob... you figured it out... ADDS! I still give 5 star rating bcs most of the time games have a lot of adds so I am used to it :v, I think it's a good game. It's very simple it's also good for children and adults but I have one problem about this! There's to many ads I put on airplane and it was fine. But it in li y worked one time. Other than that it's a good game I would have rated 4 stars after the other reviews but once I tried it was wonderful! This should get updated soon., I really enjoy this app, but I have a problem. When I try to export the clip it always export it in a super extra ultra slow motion. Am I doing something wrong? Would love to be able to shere the clips in the actual speed I choose. Tried exporting it and also direct upload to other apps and always the same problem. Please fix. And thank you for a fun/awesome app!, I love this app!!! My mom draw scribles in this app and then after a few minutes i show her a masterpiece out of her scribles!!! I really recomend this app ! Its so much fun!!! But be aware, if u wanna have fun u gotta get through some adds. Pls kick out the adds!! After that te app is amazing!!!! Oh, and i forgot it can be used with or without internet conection !!!🙂👏👏👏👏👏, Amazing app. Very calming and easy. The glow art is so much fun. You touch the pad and you have already made a glamorous glow art masterpiece piece! it's so satisfying and beautiful when you watch yourself fo it after you've finished. I recommend this app if you are into easy art, This is the most amazing app ever it's the best super FUN. But the only thing not really fun about it is when you finish you're creation theres an add and at first i couldn't really save the video because first you need to allow it the creators of this game should definitely puta all the things that you need to allow when you open you're app for the very first time so hopefully that gets fixed soon for all the new users of this game but overall it's awesome, I really love this game, And uhm you should remove the ads but I'm used to the ads so download this game. If the ads disturb you, just put it on airplane mode or turn off the wifi on your phone 😊, Think this game is really fun and other than the continuous adds I can't think of too much else wrong with it. But if you're a person who likes to play really fun running games or anything than this game probably isn't the one for you, since it is a relaxing, unwinding game. Keep it up guys, I I give this game of five stars because it is so fun so easy and you can make cool art and put it on your Instagram Facebook like stuff like that it's the best so make sure to download this game it is free on the app store I just love it so I didn't recommend to play this game it's very satisfying ok so that it it's the best I recommended it so good and 10 out of 10 five star review, This is the best game ever I'm like what I want to try makes it into three different colors and most of all I can share with all my friends that's why I really think I understand but I guess you can't do that but I like this game it's feeling my mind and my eyes and my nose with art so I just wanted to say thank you for creating this game. 🥰😘🤩, Its an amazing app, but the only reson im rating it a 4 star is because every peice of art I finish there is always an add. I hope this will get fixed soon. Other than that I really enjoy it, and I recemend this app! Keep up the good work!! 😊, I love this app because it has a lot of fun and different colours to make you something you can be fun to watch and play in your life as well if you're looking to get the amongas and other artists are not just a little bit different but they have a great variety and they have the same qualities and abilities to be able and they can I love them for their music but they do it all in a lot to me but they don't want me because they have a great deal with the music they are in and they have to do som, This App is rely nice but,I have on problem The only problem are the ads after you finish an art piece That's the only problem but still it's a really nice app I am positive that this app needs 5 star 🤩🤩😂😎🤑, Very good game , I love do draw and this is game is perfect! But there is too many ads , every time I want to watch the video of the drawing there is A ad but very great game you should download it!, •I give it a 4 star rate first imma explain its great! Its really relaxing and wonderful and it improves your drawing skills and the bad stuff about it... there r a lot of ads like when im finish drawing a ad comes up but although its a great game! For the next update can u not put so many ads pls? Thank you!•, I think that u shouldn't have to pay for some of the designs. But overall I think its a really good app if u like art and I don't really like art but I enjoyed this app.Another problem I had was that there was so many adds., I was bored in my house and asked my dad if I could color on his iPad and he said yes so I downloaded this app and started coloring and I figured out that you could duplicate the lines and It was really cool and there were also videos of the lines moving but the only thing that I didn't like was the fact that there were so many ad's, Nice game. Very beautiful colors ❤️I draw a good photos. I really like this game. This app is for who likes drawing. But there are many ads, but not problem, I like this game so much but only 1 problem that after our drawing we have to see the ads anyways I will tell you to play the this game and who have made this app I'm telling to them only that plz dont show us the ads plz, Its ok, but it would be a lot better if you had at least ten more colors added to this doodle master. It would be more suitable for children., Love this app 💝💝💝💝💝💝 It is a great app for those who want to draw and don't mind advertisements I would give it a four and a half because of the advertisements, This game is amazing! It's that one that you see on tik tok where it makes a symmetrical image. I have been looking for this app and am already using it heaps, you can also playback you're artwork which is cool., It lets me draw even when I don't have any paper around and if I don't like what I drew I can just delete it! It's one of the best drawing apps I've had, I love this app it has so beautiful thing like i just doodle and it becomes such a beautiful art and i like to spend all my free time on it. The thing i liked is that it is also offline and like i am going on a trip so i will certainly not get bored after using this app, This is the coolest thing ever, it looks hard, and hard to become a pro at, but it's like it takes over your mind, and u end up drawing the COOLEST \"stuff\" ever!, I think it is great but if you could Just make sure that the pictures don't get muddled around.And make sure that there is no adds that would be very nice. why won't it let me save it without adds.Please can you change it., There a few adds when your done but there's nothing wrong with the game it's fun but you need premium to unlock the other stuff to draw with or you can use adds there not that much to do on the game all you do is draw or dodle ya and that's it peeps!!!!!😇💚💙🌟 stay safe, One of the best games I've played you can do whatever personaly I am an arty person and when I have finished I print and use it as a card 4 stars because after ur peice advert., Can you just put a little bit of ads because its not fun when there are so many ads. when I click the finish an ad will appear everytime.Can u fix it or update this game.THX, Doodle Master - Glow Art is a great app the colours are just so nice and bright and there even rannow. And there really now wrong way to do it it makes even the worst art look amazing., Very fun app, I would get premium if it wasn't that much but I'm fine with a ad every time I wanna get extra colors, but it's quite annoying getting an ad everytime I exit something., This is a great game and also so satisfying. However, when you want to save the image, there is a sponsor for each time you save the image. It gets annoying when I get these sponsors every time. Overall, this is a great game for you to play and unwind with., It is a really good game great time killer and everything but I do think that there is a little to many ads after every drawing you have an ad but other than that it is awesome, I liked this app a lot but there arent as many drawing options as there can be suppose: Undo and redo and blur and smudge.This app is very good though., I could literally play this game all night. This game is like whatever you draw is beautiful using this game like OMG I really like it, keep up with the great work!, Love this app Im giving only 4stars because it sometimes gliches and re toooooo many adds . Hope you can reduce the number of adds . And fix the little glitches ... But in the end its totally worth it ☺️, I really love this game it is so much fun you can literally design anything but... the thing that is most frustrating is that there is ads everywhere after your done drawing something so this game is going way over board with the ads, Its a great game and I'll play it all day long so relaxing and exciting for beginners of the arts the only problem is all the ads they keep you from doing the art but besides that it's a great game]</td>\n      <td>com.doodle.master.draw.glow.art</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>com.appxstudio.smokearteffect</th>\n      <td>Smoke Name Art - Smoky Effect Focus n Filter Maker</td>\n      <td>Smoke Name Art app allows you to create creative and artistic style of name for signature to add your signature to other photos or as your email signature.

An app shouldn't make money by giving people no option other than buying premium. It should be good enough that people want premium because they enjoy it and want to go the next step up. It feels forced and I don't want to have to buy premium because I know Adobe always raises prices regularly, I absolutely love Spark Post. I use it on both my phone and chromebook for all of my graphic design needs. I broke down and purchased a subscription and I have not regretted it AT ALL. Aside from having maybe too much to choose from now 😁. I will say that the app gets into a \"mood\" from time to time and that can be quite frustrating, but thats when I just switch over to the chromebook. Awesome program all around though, please don't ever get rid of it, Adobe!!!!, I used to like this, but now it won't even export my designs to my phone. I've been a long time user of Adobe products as a professional photographer, and never have issues with the lightroom, or photoshop, as a CC membership holder, I thought I'd try this for my Insta stories. Edit: I revisited after trying a bunch of other apps, and it's getting better! It's a little buggy depending on what device I'm using it on, but I'm liking the new features! I'll give it another star. 3 instead of 2., I was struggling to find an application that could allow me to use my phone just the same as I would use Publiser on my Laptop ans when I found this man was I elated! I love it, it's super easy to use, it has lots of templates to use and on top of that you can custom design your own posters! I'd suggest it to anyone!, This last update screwed me. Some of the fonts, including the one I use for my marketing material, has switched and now looks like the font I have my phone set to (cool jazz). Every post I have saved has for some reason switched the font to something to resembles cool jazz. UPDATE: I switched the font on my phone back to the original font and restarted my phone. That seems to have fixed the issue., I love the app and I enjoyed using it but I wish the features of controlling every layer should bring to live. Like sending back the first layer to backward. Viseversa. Wish the Developer will give all the user more freedom to do how we want to create and customized things depending on the assets, I make Youtube videos and I have found this app most helpful in creating thumbnails, logos and water marks. You can pay for more features but I found the free version was more then adequate for creating professional looking images. I have tried a variety of other apps and this one seems to have the best features all on the one app., Super cool. You can create really good post or wallpaper or somthing like that even in free version. They give lot of features for the free version like animations, thousands of icons and images and lot more. I didn't see any ads since i downloaded this. Really useful. Really easy to use., I Loooove this app!! It's so convenient and easy to use on my phone when I'm on the go. I love to use it for my YouTube thumbnails as well as my Salon advertisements. The uses are endless!! Great job Adobe!!, Icons are nice. Fonts are nice. Everything about it is just so convenient. Please do consider adding a zoom-in function because it's really hard editing on a phone🥺 this app is what I use for school projects and I'd say it's the best one yet., I think spark post is the best and l love the functions and setup and I appreciate what they can up with the option of removing the logo on the picture and It is a very nice app to use and I think they can reach at a point of becoming better than Canva if the keep up with the good work, Great app! I use it for my book covers on Wattpad and they always draw attention! If you're looking for an easy app to use for covers or youtube thumbnails, this is the one for you!, Its very Good! The only thing is sometimes when I put a Png, it forgets to cut it in a few parts But the cutting is very good. In General, this app is good to edit photos, Very straightforward app. User friendly. It's not blotted with a lot of unnecessary features and fonts. Top marks., Took me a minute to figure out how to use to my advantage on each design. Do not like the water remove fee. Is it included when I register and pay for subscription to Adobe DC fill and sign?, This app is incredible! I love how easy it makes it to add your branding to any image/video. Better than any of the alternatives I've tried., Every update is frustrating! Anything you create and save reverts back to its old form when you repoen it. All changes get lost! Why can't this be a stable app ever?, it is a great app really, but for the watermarks though 🤦‍♂️ not all of us can manage subscription fees we still young please, other wise I highly recommend it!, Great Content Creation on the Go. The free version offers a lot of functionality. One can get really good looking content with this app. Can give canva a good run for its money., Amazing editor. Free version is fantastic and offers more than what i need. Highly recommended., tried 10 apps @20mb and under ; some came close but none worked w/o high anxiety . . 60mb was the charm . . there's just too much going on technically to do this low budget ; which is why there's a video after ea pic. The beta here works but you have to poke around a bit. I hope you keep it ., It was a great app before this update but now there is no shapes option that attracts the most. I want that shape option back this update is not good., Love it! Super easy to use. The more that I create things the easier it gets. I'm so glad there is a mobile app so that I can take care of business the go!, the font issue has been fixed, unfortunately I had no opportunity to e-mail them about the problem... this is a really great application if you want to make something quickly or let your creativity run wild. I think subscription prices could be cheaper, but dont let that discourage you from downloading. You will enjoy every moment designing with this app., Completely awesome... I only wish the animation could be used differently for each sentence on the same page, What an amazing app, fantastic for creating graphics and designing your own content. Best app i have used., Even without an Adobe subscription it's easy to use and produces professional results., Great free pics provided, tools have been updated, fun and easy to use., Im giving 5 for making it easy for people to learn basics. Need some more tools and options for making animated posters and colorful icons., The New Update is great! II have been using this for my stories for over a year now and no issues what so ever. Just a suggestion for the grids when making a poster is could you add some diagonal grids. I like to make a stories a little more enticing. If that comes in the next update. I'll be happy!, This app is great for making anything creative like invitations, wallpapers, collages and creating beautiful backgrounds with a wide range of pictures on the platform to use. The only thing is that there aren't a lot of font options to choose from and they aren't very exciting the ones that are there. Other than that, there are many templates to use as well and more. I totally reccomend you use Adobe Spark Post for any of your creative needs! Go install it!, I like Adobe spark post enough to continue using it. However it can improve. There a glitches when it comes to ongoing jobs. If started on the phone app, they may not show on the desktop version and vice-versa. Also, the phone app has fewer possibilities in the editing process in comparison to the desktop version, which limits the best work to a computer environment and, as a business owner, I tend to be on the go more than on a desk. Other than that, I am pleased., This was a wonderful app before you decided to remove the \"Design\" option. It was quick and easy way for me to find to a preferred templet and tinker with it a little till I get what I what. I'm not a creative genius so I need some hand holding and now that's gone. Please bring it back Edit: Thanks for the update. 5 stars again. Edit 2: Now why does the Design option not shuffle the text and the position as I see in the preview? It keeps changing the colour. Is it just me?, Be very careful. I downloaded the app via Google and paid for the full subscription. This, it seems, was done by a Google and not Adobe. When I got a new phone, I was logged out and when I launched the app from the new phone, it went to an Adobe log in screen. I put in my email and password and it created a new account and over wrote all my previous work. It also meant the subscription was no longer recognised. Apparently I should have logged back in via Google. There is no pre warning of this, Best for designing on mobile, but had a bug from last 2-3 months. Sometimes it goes like I am designing my post and all of a sudden everything on canvas vanishes or lost and after this you have to start designing from the beginning., I really enjoy this app. I had it on my other phone and I was at work trying to find an app that I could use to make flyers. I am glad I remembered this app. And you can even remove the Spark logo on the free acct. I am really contemplating becoming a paid member., It is an awesome tool for a global teacher like me. I create digital content and lesson materials for my students on the go, using the adobe spark. It has been very useful. I purchased the premium package and my content have been awesome. Thank you for developing and always improving on the app. 👍👌🥰, I love this app so much. the only thing I hate about it is that at some point it freezes and closes by it self, Any learning designer will be lucky to have Spark Post. It's easy to use. It brings to life whatever you envision. It also gives you options like templates to jump start your creative side., I love this app, but it can be very buggy. And when I have a deadline to put out a flier or whatever, having to restart/reinstall the app just to have certain features work, it's a huge hindrance on my work/time. Ie. Cannot search for templates through app. Searching through browser works, but I can't transfer any of them to the app. Also the spacing on the boxes around lettering will change or move for no reason and won't allow me to line things up properly until I close the app and restart]</td>\n      <td>com.adobe.spark.post</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>com.starstable.horses</th>\n      <td>Star Stable Horses</td>\n      <td>Care for your very own baby foal!

I played it when I didn't have a computer and hadn't even heard of star stable. This game could use some alternations. But other than that highly recommend great for children just be carful with the buying feature!, Star stable horses is a great app, if you play star stable online. Star stable online is a horse game and sometimes they update this app and they bring in new horses to this app. So you raise them from a foal to a horse. And after they reach level 10, you can buy that horse with star coins ( that cost real money ) to transfer that horse into star stable so you can ride it. So this is a really good app if you have star stable online., I love this app, but I would like to be able to rase more then two horses at ones. I also wish that you could see each other training. Also, I wish that it didn't cost ster coins., They should make it so that all the stalls are free plz do make all the stalls free and other than that it is amazing!...... I just edited my review and I uninstalled the app now it won't redownload I'm very sad cause there is a new horse but my little sister has the the app on her phone and she got the new horse for me... Well Byeeeeee! I'm still sad tho..., Awesome app! But it could use some changes. I dont like how you have to wait like a few days to level them up and put them in the game.And i thought the horses were free to put in the game not logging in and buying with star coins and please update where you dont have to buy anything.It would really be fun if the horses were free to put in the game! Please read this star stable and update!! Thanks! Love sso by the way!, Great Game! I love it. There's just a little twist. When your horses are level 10, you go on horse stables online. I made my character and horse on apple IPhone, but it wasn't letting me in because I might need a computer I dont remember if you need a computer because it was back in 2019., This game is amazing but when you transfer horses it says eror and I keep trying but it doesn't work. I even try re-installing it., I really like this game and I can see that a lot of people are complaining about the star coins to transporter the horse but if you create a new account you press on the gift and get free gifts and it is way cheaper than in game only 25 star coins most horses are like 4985 for example star coins its a big difference., I love the game, you train up the horses and transfer them to the game. But...The animations for one, are lusitano and another idk. Two, I'm not hating but why do you have to wait longer and longer to finish training the horse. Otherwise it's a good game and I would recommend. Also Sunshine Davis-Ray... The game is FOR LEVELING UP **FOALS** TO PUT IN THE ACTUAL GAME. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT IF YOU DONT HAVE THE GAME!, This app is cool! I would recommend people to download this app! This app is about having your own horses to take care of. But, the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I cannot go to star stables online which is only on PC and Mac to transfer my level 10 horses. But, as I said it is still a good game., This game is the best game on the entire planet.I've had this game for 4 years and I am in Love with it.The updates are incredible and the horses were to begin,they are beautiful DEFINATLEY a 5 star review!🐎💖💖, I really recommend this game but it takes a while to play it on the laptop I've been waiting all day, Ok my past review was stupid, I love this game all the way and love all the hard work you guys put into this and your bigger game sso. I appreciate all the hard work and the hours you and your team do day after day. Thank you for making this so enjoyable star stable! 💕, Great game nonetheless but I have a star stable account but I don't have a PC or Mac and I can't play star stable and I hope you can make star stable online for mobile users too. And please add more horses because they all look amazing, I love this game but you can only have two horses unless your willing to spend real money. Also the graphics are good but you have to wait until the next day for more levels. I would give a 5 star but, i am not that happy I am told that the computer version is better. I would recommend this game to horse lovers., Hello star stable can you soon add a limited edition horse on this game. I love star stable online and I think its wonderful. But for the next limited edition horse can it be 750 star coins. Thank you! Kind regards Your craziest fan who who plays sso, It's honestly well-made. These people who are complaining about \"Oh! It's costs so much like I can't afford that!111!!11!1!\" are just ignorant because it clearly states in the game desc that you \"... then transport your horse to the magical world of Star Stable Online! ...\" which costs Star Coins. It's self-explainatory, really. Anyways, I love the horses on this app, keep up the great work!! &lt;3, UPDATE: even after contacting both google play and the star stable developer I STILL have not received a refund!!! DO NOT PURCHASE anything from this developer! Paid for full options, now the options aren't available anymore. I don't even know how to get a refund or get it fixed so i just paid 5.99 for absolutely nothing. NOT HAPPY. And yes I have tried contacting the developer., I love this! I just wish starstable was mobile as well, this game is lovely for starters! The horses are beautiful., I love the game so much because you can raise foals! And bing them to sso when thier level 10! But I wish their was an app version of sso because theirs probbly a lot of people that want to play sso but don't have computers or mac,pc. So is that to much to ask?, Very limited. In order to keep your horse &amp; ride you must join their yearly membership. Which only seems to be on PC (my daughter doesn't own a PC). Graphics are nice, beyond that this is boring since you only train babies. I'll happily change my review if they add more to this app. Allow users to ride their trained horses. It doesn't have to be your full system but a limited like a sample., This is a well made game I believe that this game is not only uselfull it is also very entertaining as you can do tasks to level up your horse faster than how you would level up your horse in SSO. This games graphics aren't too bad but I've had some glitches during transfering my horses Otherwise this game is amazing💯, Parents, Don't waste your time. I installed this game to try and help my 4 year old daughter get a few horses since she only has the one she started with. After training the horse they wanted the equivalent of about $25 to move the horse to the online game PER HORSE. This game and the online version is an absolute rip off. Going to to find my child a new game to play., It's ok. But my requests are that you add more skins to all of the horses.And you make it where you can train the horses faster, I know this is good games but level up is so slow im waite few days and ride the horse, I love this game it helps me go through this struggling time. I've message Star Stable Online through YouTube there is only one thing that's disappointing me I would really like if you guys could do. I think that it would be great if you could add 3 new horses my three I was thinking was The new Jorvik Frieson I would love them. The next2 horse is a streach but maybe you could add the zonys or ayla/umbra. Add all patterns with friesian. Both zony patterns and magic forms of ayla and umbra TYSM❤️, This game is awsome but if you could add a riding part or riding events or somthing like that and could you get more stalls by leveling up not paying otherwise i love it, Really good to get horses u can't get in star stable. For people that are complaining that they can't get star stable, this game is mainly FOR star stable so your issue. It's amazing and not laggy at all, This is really fun now. My mum got me sso. Plz add marwaris and some other horses like that also when you transfer, it works. This game is good if your willing to buy a akahi teke, clydlesdale, irish cob and other breeds., I lov this app I love the new embermane horse maybe you can add a new horse in red like the blue and black horse that was limited and a update where you can ride your trained horses, I love it and I have friends and the real game itself also being a Star Rider but I have a issue. Every time I get on the game it does not let me play.j hope sso fixes it and I already reinstalled it and it still does the same, I love the game. It's really fun to play. The only thing I don't exactly like is the take care of the horse you have to be online but other than that I love the game, It is so amazing that u can put level 10 horses in star stable!! But the only thing that is bugging me about this app is that u have to buy stable boxes and themes., I'm giving this app a two star because the game is okay but when I go try to play sso it says I can only play on mac or pc i don't have either witch i was annoyed about so maybe you could change that so mobile and tabs can play as soon as possible but otherwise the game is good, I love this game but when it comes to transfering horses to SSO why is it so many Star Coins? Can't you lower the price a little? If you can't what's the point of buying horses here instead of buying them in SSO?, The reason is because there is 3 things. One, to get a nother horse other than 2 it costs money. Two, to get more options on food it costs money. And three I have a UMX phone and it just sucks that i cannot play SSO and if you do change it do not make it so you need to pay money. So if you do fix this i might recommend this gam other wise i hate this game. PLEASE JUST CHANGE THESE THINGS PPPLLLEEEAAASSSEEE, I love this game, but my horse gets really tired even when I first started this game. Can you please make them not that tierd so fast. Thank you because I love this game so much. 😍😍😍, I love how u can age up the horses and tranfer them to your account but i think the first horse u traing should be free or all horses should be free because i did both my hirses every day to level 10 and i only have 30 star couns i didnt kniw it was so much so PLEASE STAR STABLE JUST MAKE THE FIRST HORSE U TRAIN FREE PLEASE, This is an amazing game but I wish you wouldn't have to wait a full day so that you can level up.Is there anyway that you could cut down the time to 5-10 minutes, Best game ever! But to make it fun even more, daily star coins to be able to afford em? It' sucks cause we can't afford it!]</td>\n      <td>com.starstable.horses</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>com.cleverapps.candyriddles</th>\n      <td>Candy Riddles: Free Match 3 Puzzle</td>\n      <td>Enjoy Candy Riddles - the sweetest match 3 puzzle!

I'm not watching the ad for a booster again!!!!, easy, relaxing game to play if you are trying to kill time, Fun and cute. The Heroes totally rock!!!😻😻😽😽👩‍🚒👩‍🚒👩‍🚒, The app is good that ice cream, lemon........... All so cute it’s really nice app *Relaxing mind *But this app is like a *CANDY CRUSH* app *There is no life time for any levels *I think this app wants to little bit of devolpment., Love your game! When I get stuck usually can earn something to help. One problem on level 1348, says I need 4 honey pots and none on left on the board. What am I doing wrong? Thanks, I really enjoy playing this game but what happened to the three choice boxes before the game?!!? No more heroes to help on hard levels. And now I have to \"buy\" the boosters. The update sucks., Unobtrusive match-3 game, hardly any battery drainage, unlike others. This was my primary choice in choosing this game (38MB). Always bonuses and nice to play another game within this game. I really,really love this game. *An issue should be addressed: when I win 15 or 30 minutes free play,I shouldn't be losing lives. I started the game with 5 lives and won 15 minutes after losing one life. It notified me 15 mins were up yet, I only had 1 life left. Not Fair-plse fix this issue., Up until now 5 stars. Once I started having to wait for new episodes the game will not update on my tablet. It does on my PC but I like to play in bed before I go to sleep so not playing as much as I would like., It isn't as friendly as I would have thought. The game starts out making the player think, unlimited moves. Then by level 5 or 10, suddenly you are limited by number of moves. And money, well, let's see. First they want money for coins, then it's money to upgrade characters, then it's money for, what was it, clovers, I believe. The song, \"Money Greedy,\" comes to mind when I see all the things they want money for. I know these app developers need to make a buck but there is such a thing as greed., I absolutely love this slide match 3 game! The characters are adorable. It's game play is unique compared to other slide match 3 games. The different levels are refreshing and it's great in it's simplicity. When I start playing \"Candy Riddles\" I can't stop; that is until one of my sons or husband are hungry and need food! A CUTE game that I just love. This game deserved the 5 stars I gave it! Keep up wonderful job you're doing! 💛👍👍, I love it so far. But rewards need to be explained better. I used probably 6-900 coins after some levels bc I didn't know it was costing me my coins to tap to double the reward. Also...how about instead of giving 3 hours of free playing time all the time....give out some power ups. I must have enough free play time for the next 2 weeks. Its unreasonable to expect ppl to be okay with that reward all the time...bc no one is going to use it all--might as well be 20 hours. so mix it up. 💜, This is a very cute game. I like how interactive it is. My only problem is one that I run into in other games as well,this game plays ITSELF quite a bit. I find myself wanting to make moves,just when i think the chain reaction is complete and as soon as I lift my finger....\"DULP🤦🏼‍♀️\"the PRIOR move is STILL GOING. Otherwise I'd say 5 stars., I love the board characters in this game they're very different and interesting. Unfortunately the board play is rather slow and boring. Doesn't seem to be anything to encourage continued play. Definitely a bare-bones match 3 game. Would love to see some extras., I have really been enjoying this game. It was fun and relaxing until those pesky timer pieces showed up. I hate being rushed while playing. Having to rush while playing is stressful. I do appreciate the extra time bonuses I recieved as rewards. I purchased the 3-day unlimited play before winning the bonuses. Get rid of those bombs!, it's been one if my favorite games ever but for 3 days I can't get past level 630 because it won't give me enough red stars to complete the level, I wrote for support &amp; can't even get an answer! Update, I have tried everyway to reach the admins &amp; no answers in weeks I guess I'm wasting my time. I finally got an answer, it was my malfuction instead of the game's...I was at the point that I was trying to make myself uninstall the app, I'm so glad I didn't, it's by far one of my all times favorites!, i just started playing this game today and i luv it. i can't seem to stop playing it. great game lots of fun and extremely addictive. download and start playing now, and you'll fully understand what i'm ranting about... diffinatly worth the five (5) star's !*****, Don't think I'll be keeping this one... Barely enough moves or the pieces you need to get through the levels and the bonus stinginess is unfair just because I refuse to spend money on any game... If I want to deal with that kind of headache I'd play Candy Crush!!!! Nobody's original anymore, so sad!!, This looks like a little kids game, but dont be fooled. Unique, challenging and fun!!!! The hero's you collect through out the game, really help you pass levels.On the down side, most levels are the same, and that gets boring. Uninstalling., it doesn't give the coins or items for watching the videos and when the piggy bank pops up saying it is full and to purchase the game freezes and you have to close out of the game. fix these problems and it will be a good game. i don't have anything else running in the background., Cool, fun and exciting game. I think anyone would like it. If you like match 3 games. This one is fun and easy to play. It's does gets llittle more hard as u get to higher levels. That how it should be. Thanks for the game., Ive had this game for a while but 2day i played &amp; had 195 coins when i came back to play i had 70? where did my 125 go? this is the 2nd time this happened &amp; when i purchase more moves &amp; go to play it takes my $$$ &amp; starts me over from the beginning &amp; i loose the lives/moves that ive purchased. i uodated 5/30/19 &amp; i had to update again 2day 6/10/19? whats going on??? i love the game but im seriously thinking about uninstalling it unless you guys have a solution to my dilemma., I truly enjoy this game~~the more levels you get to is getting pretty challenging...I like it but the higher you get the harder it gets...really puts your mind so to speak to work overtime!!!! But your brain does need a good amount of challenge to focus correctly, to stay focused~~~I certainly know that~~~LOL!!!! 🍀🌟🐦🌞🦋⚛💫🌈🤩🌱💫☪️🍀🍀⚜⚜⚜✔✔✔, Love the beginning but I am elderly and play for fun. Wish they would stop upgrading me part way into it. Then I have to uninstall and start over., was enjoying this game till it would not let me buy any coins. then it never gives you enough donuts to feed the mice. what a shame to a fun game. hope it gets fixed soon., Well I truly loved playing this game before the recent update...now after EVERY match a stupid ad pops up and breaks my \"smooth\" playing experiance. Oh well , \"another one bites the dust\" !!!, this new update on 3/23/19 has completely ruined this experience for me! i feel that, i need to unistall! crazy ads popping up even when the app has been closed?! i loved this game, before today!!!, Love this game - never get bored, lots of variety to the games. I have run out of levels though, when are you adding more. completed 1900., i made purchased of Super Pack (Candy Riddles: Free Match 3 Puzzle) on 3rd Nov and have been deducted from my purchase credit i also got the confirmation by email but i don't received the pack yet. so please give me back my credit balance or just give the pack that i've been paid. !!!!!! or i will report this, Was great up until level 1456 and now unable to play, as it won't let you get past the notification to press skip and play the level. Please fix this bug., A very sweet game. It's a bit challenging which I appreciate. But still really enjoyable. Something I can't wait to come back and play., Love this game, just don't like having to wait for new episodes every week. still can't access updates from 12/02/19, I am a match 3 hound but this one if I could would give it a 10. Game is awesome I love it. Free lives you can win, hat's off to the developers just wish it said how many levels.. Please keep them coming..., Starts off great but becomes too difficult too soon ...even if you purchase powerups or extra moves. Takes all the fun out of it. Had to un-install, I💖 THIS GAME. But, it keeps cutting off my \"I 💖 RADIO \". I only play games that let me listen to my music while I play. 😢 Could you please fix ?, Love the game. Can be extremely aggravating at times. Just have yo put it up for awhile and then go back to it., It's a good game so far... I haven't had to pay any $$$ to pass a level yet. But I'm sure it will happen soon enough., Beautiful easy game to play. I do find this game relaxing and the graphics are excellent. I would recommend people to try t out, its good game. Cheers.!!!!!😁😇😎🍉🍐🌰🍄🌶🍍🌽🍎🍅🍋🧀🍈🍇🎄🎉🌎🇬🇭🇬🇪, One of my new favorite games, but why did you stop the interaction with the characters in the higher levels? That was the fun part!, A brilliant match 3 game. I can't wait until more levels are released. I've cleared all levels, just waiting for more., I like this game, enjoyable to play But it gets hard pretty fast.

You have to buy bots when you reach the SECOND WORLD !!!!! I bought 1 bot so that my kid could complete the SECOND WORLD . But then you need four bots to progress further . And at the beginning you only get two bots !! Please fix this ., Four levels? Required in app purchases to play more than the first level? Minimum purchase is $7.99 (US)? Surely this is just a big con that I fell for. I'm not opposed to spending money on games, developers work hard to make content and should be compensated for it. However, this is just robbery. My kid played through the whole game in about a day -- that's the makings of a $0.99 game, not the money that this one costs. The actual game play isn't that bad, nor is it unappealing graphically, but it's an unmitigated waste of money. If there were any way under the terms of use that I could request a refund, I surely would. Lesson learned for me, and here's hoping anyone reading this doesn't make the same mistake., The game becomes practically unplayable after a few levels without paying. And from what I see in some reviews, even after paying the game is finished in no time at all., As others have said... it's fun for your child until they get the level where they need three bots, and only get two for free. So suddenly a free game becomes a game that you have to pay for. If you want to avoid tantrums (or paying for worthless downloadable BS), don't download it., I love it but I do hope they make a verison where all the other bots are FREE and the game.every time i reinstall my game i dont start at the begining and i want to restart my progress, This locks content behind pay walls. Very early on the game becomes literally unplayable until you pay $8 per transformer or $16 for all of them. \"Free games\" are just a time consuming ads littered with other ads. Safe to all all or most games by this developer are like this., Yup cant even play some missions as you need 3 bots , if you want to buy more its 8bucks for one or 15 for all, Good, but it forces you to pay for characters so you can proceed with the game, Because my brother's trying to play this game and he doesn't have enough to defeat them more Bot you only have to he should have three I don't know how to defeat them more Bot but if you can please just give him one more robot, A money hungry game. You play basically one level and then need to pay to get another bot. Developers should hang their heads in shame with this blatant greed. Disgusting, It's a good game. Yes, you have to pay if want to continue playing with different autobots but it isn't that expensive considering. It's free initially but after that, of course you have to pay. I think it's worth it because my child plays it quite often and has yet to get super bored though I find it redundant. It's four levels, from what I noticed, that you can play with different Autobots. He's happy so it works for me., I hate this game because you have to pay real money! Why not game money. With game money more people will play. Then you could get five stars ratings., the only thind wrong is i think you need to be online to by autobots but nomatter what i absolutely my favorite game thank you budge studios for making this game i hope you make more transfomers rescue bots games i would like a transformers rescue bots roleplaying game������, Mega let down! My son loves the Rescue bots and I got the game for him to enjoy. going swimmingly until he completed the first level. Now I have to pay for more bots to play without another option to earn the bots. And he can't replay models. Now I have a very unhappy little boy because he can't play...seriously unfair people and underhand. To others - If you are not prepared to spend £5 don't buy this game., terribe game. would be zero stars except that's not an option. only two bots and first level free. cannot advance to any additional levels unless you pay for additional bots to unlock levels. each bot costs anywhere from $2 to $5 or more. not everyone has disposable income to shell out more and more money just so their kids can continue playing. way to pander to the rich, jerks., I dont mind paying to play, I get it, that's the purpose of these games. But, to lock out the level I just paid for, and then charge me another 4.99??? That's diiiiiiirty. My kid cant even play with the characters he just got. He was so excited to have OP and BumB on the same team. 5 minutes later, hes upset that he cant play with them anymore. Go ahead and vait folks to progress in the game by paying more, but dont deny access to what we have already paid for. Terrible...., Last time I tried this game I needed 3 bots but now I can only use 2 bots! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! I love this game it's better than any transformer game thanks!, Disappointed! My son loves playing this game. Thing is... I just purchased the Rescue bots package for him two days ago on February 21st for $5.99. My son only moved to the next level up; the bots LOCKED back up &amp; now charging another $4.99. A waste of my money! Now my son is upset because he doesn't have his bots anymore. I CANNOT afford to keep paying into this game!, As they said it's not worth it when it's saying three bots please fix it so you will get 5 stars, My little five-year-old started playing. called me over wanted me to spend 8 bucks just to get a a new robot so he could continue playing .I said no mate they're trying to get you in. this is how these people trick you. be very careful of apps like this. Now my little 5 year old is more educated how the world works and realises that all you see is not as it seems. Deleted., DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless you want to pay money to not disappoint your kids. The game forces you to make a purchase after the first level because you start with two transformers and need three to continue. Each costs 2.99 or 4.99 for all of them. Not a lot a money but it shouldn't be advertised as FREE!, No educational value and you must buy to proceed. I don't mind buying games that have an educational value. This game will easily become boring and it's a waste of 4.99. Capitalism and generation of revenue is the lifeblood of all businesses but as a parent this game misses the mark as a good game for a kid. If you added math to it, I would buy it., Impossible to win for free you only get 2 characters and you have to pay 9.99 for all the characters and theres no decepticons the one rule of transformers instead it's with dr Morocco the only 2 good characters are optimus and bumblebee dont let your kid play, Can only get so far before you are required to purchase a robot to continue. No way to earn it for free, I don't recommend., My son can't even play past Mission 1 without payment for required bots?! He's 4 yrs old! Run some ads and make your money by allowing the option to view them rather than ripping off kids. Ridiculous. He's really sad and doesn't understand why I have to delete the game since he doesn't understand currency. THANKS! 👍, Very upsetting. My son was so excited for this game til it made it a requirement to buy more characters. Do not waste your time., Why do we have to pay for the fourth level?? If budge studios see this why don't you guys give us all the characters because It's 7.99 derhams for me and I don't want to pay that kinda money on just a game!!! Like who even does that dude!! That's why I give this app a 1 STAR OKAY BUDGE STUDIOS!! 😠😠😠, I Give this Game 4.3 Stars. 👍 Transformers Rescue Bots: Disaster Dash Game Pros: 💖Good Game Tutorial 💖Nice Game Control 💖It's better than similar games. 💖Good Game Smoothness 💖Clear Words. 👏 Thanks to Budge Studios ❤️ My Youtube Channel 👉 bettypvp, The thing is here is that the characters I can't buy them! This is why I hate the game cause! How am I! Suppose to finish the game if you can't get them in game! How about this new gamemode? 🤔 That the game is much fun the gamemode (this is the new mode I want) is with game cash so that you can get the other characters is it (a yes or no) answer it by the next few days to let you think about it okay👌&amp; let me know if you agree gamers with the new mode? Is a Deal? 👌😋, Highway robbery!. Downloaded this for my kid and then saw the pay to play.. i get maybe $.99 for the upgrade but these fools want $8 just to finish the first levels. Get bent! Thanks for disappointing my kid. Scammers!, Worst game in the play store, my son came to me asking me to fix it for him only to realize you have to buy the bots to play the game... poor choice, way better games out there that are truly free... 10 out of 10 wouldn't recommend, Paid to unlock all characters and within days they were locked again. Some time later I though I would try again and paid to unlock all characters again. The app took my money but the characters did not unlock. Definitely do not recommend!, Not really free. You get only a couple of free worlds and then they force you to pay to continue. I Understand if you make it hard to play for free but not impossible to play for free. App was deleted., Can only play one level and then if you want to continue on, you have to purchase additional rescue bots. Very disappointing that there isn't a way to earn the bots. My boys were very upset to not be able to continue on in this game., please fix the controls on the second part of the tornado level. it is unresponsive. thank you problem has been resolved, and my son is happy. he says that it is awesome working with the autobots., My son loves being able to choose his team and at 4 years old gets very excited to pass levels and open up new adventures he also loves catching energon and switching into the different robot prototypes..to pay 4.99 to unlock all the characters is a cheap and easy upgrade to enjoy the whole team..., I would have gave you 5 star if you take some odf the money away. I am bored playing the same character over and over again. Every single game has money. Please atleast this or some other game, cancel money to purchase anything. 😭😠, Cannot play game for free (by design). Game requires you to select 3 characters but only gives you 2 to choose from. Don't waste your time only to let your kid down., Its not fair that after completing the volcanoe place you have to have 3 bots and you have to use actual cash to purchase!!!, UPDATE**** Issue resolved, rating updated. Thank you! Took my money but didnt give me any additional access. Emailed the designer listed and got no response.

I like this game, but these things need to be changed then everyone would benefit from it and you will get a higher rating than 5 stars. 1- You need to keep the currency for buildings the same and use gold for other instances. 2- One thing that annoys me is: You build 3 houses and factories? And then it comes on that you have more jobs than people, then the city planner tells you that you need more jobs. I don't believe so. Fix it!!!, Update: I will change my review once you have that kind of features cheers! I will play and love this game if the building can be upgraded and change the design when you upgrade, for example if I want to upgrade a house the looks of each level be different. Just like the Millionaire City before in Nokia game., Uninstalling this game, keep setting up businesses and homes but sadly losing so many towns people. Maybe if the lands weren't so expensive to purchase or the businesses or the houses maybe I could keep my towns people, but you've made that impossible. It's sad cause I was liking this game., Giving 1 star for the pop-ups timed to appear as you click sth else and force you to the App Store. Instead of downloading the ad's game, came here to rate Town City. Happy., Oh man, this is the game for anyone who likes building on a Sim level. Fun. Hours of entertainment. Easy to understand &amp; play. Love it and have 4 running on my phone. More more more!, These my opinion about this game.. 1.I love this very much 💞💞but the ad always emerge...btw this game very fun it's suitable for people who love play city game..about the ad better you improve it quicklyyyy, The game is decent. The graphics are cute and colorful. But theres not enough \"stuff\". Theres only 3 or 4 buildings for the beach and so far no businesses for Leisurly Luxury island. Would be nice if there were more options for buildings. I also HATE that when you purchase a home with $$ it then changes to only being able to purchase with gold. And the lots are pretty expensive. It really forces you to purchase things. But, it passes the time and I like that you can move on to different islands, I enjoy playing because it is a clean game. You don't have to worry about not being able to move forward because your not paying to get the really good upgrades., Nice game; but typical *Pay to win* concept ; have to wait for hours if u dont buy money top up; even if u think u can make ur way by watching ads its not possible Precisely; a waste of time if u r looking for gaming experience, Please fix the bugs. I just upgrade house, about few minutes to be done. But suddenly the waiting turns im you 5 hours of waiting. What is going on? I was enjoying this game tho. But suddenly it came out error, The game is somewhat fun. It relies on the use of purchased gold to get things done rapidly. Earned gold could take years to accomplish anything useful. The annoying part, is after being stupid enough to purchase gold, the ads still pop up unexpectedly taking you to Google play to install more junk. Every game I have ever spent money on at least turns off the ads, but not this one. I will continue to play this game, though not with the same enthusiasm as when I first started., Such a poorly made game.. the graphic, concept, sound effect(music) are so childish ! At least the developers could try .. for now, this game is only for babies. uninstalled, and I don't recommend it, Superb game. I am so in love. This game is the key tool for any bidding politician at mayoral level or national politics level., Interesting game but you can't really get gold coins unless you buy with a credit card......and majority of buildings have to be purchased with gold., When I first saw this game I got excited, because it reminded me of the one I play on my PC, and this is for an Android tablet. However I became very discouraged when I realized this game gives you a five-second ad about every 2 or 3 minutes. Maybe it's 5. I watch ads on my own on the PC game and this one interrupts my play. So more than likely I will not continue to play, because it's a complete nuisance to have a five-second advertisement interrupt you every few minutes., i played this game before but after i log in again using my previous account, it say the building need to wait 274 days to construct. pls fix this because i really enjoyed this game, Really enjoying the game, I think the only thing that I would change is being able to rotate property's all the way round, I have questions for customer service and no one to talk to. The game should give more coins out weather in a spin whee watching movies etc.., Great game doesn't add bomb you all the time or slant the game. Just because they want you to purchase more bits for the game. Very even balanced game., Too few opportunities to earn gold and the gold earned are insufficient. How can you have islands without ports and you can't buy a port because you are not afforded the option of buying any sea property? I refer to frozen forest and versatile views. Also why do you change the currency in which people can buy houses and businesses? Keep to one standard currency please. In one day one is tasked to spend 1000 gold yet the maximum amount of gold earned at once is 100 after unlocking all islands., Fantastic game!!! Buildings look so neat and clean. We can zoom and see too. No challenges; so you can just build your city the way you want and enjoy it thoroughly as long as you can. Best part is no annoying ads to disturb you. Thank you!!!, Great at beginning but now earning gold has become impossible. What happened to the Discover Apps earing 1 gold???, I really like this game but it has some issues. The speed ups for X2 the profit and faster time in 15 min has stopped working. That's how I made my gold coins. Its extremely difficult to get the coins and it's also hard to get the money to buy land plots on the islands. I truly hope you can come up with other ways to be able to get more coins and money faster. I'm so far in the game I really don't want to quit, its disappointing when you have to play for weeks to get see any results, Love the game, but why is it so expensive to purchase land extentions, also homes and buildings , don't want to cancel game but it takes foe ever you expand land and build ?, This one is my favorite from Sparkling Society thus far. Love the graphics, the ample amount of islands, the functionality - you can earn money so fast. Earning gold is actually reasonable with this app! And of course continuous play offline. If only the City Island versions could get updates, to be on par with this one. Very pleased at present. *Excessive amount of exclamation notifications on the board btw. As you try to collect profits they seriously get in the way*, Congratulations Sparkling Society! You finally got it right! I've tried playing your simulation games for years now and it hasn't been all bad, but gave up because they ultimately had to many problems to be worth playing. I've been playing thus one for 2 days now and already see such a difference. The game is enjoyable and easy to play., Really great gameplay! I have a lot of fun with it. I havent had any problem with bugs or glitches, and it runs smoothly. Its addictive, a great time waister, and great for all ages. You can understand how to play if your young and its interesting enough to ppay when you're older. My only actual problem with the game is that it took a few tries to get it downloaded (im almost certain this was my phone's fault and not the game's) I really enjoyed it, I think most people do too., I love this game! So easy to build. Unlike other games, Town City gives enough coins to build up the town I look forward to working on my town everyday., I love this game! The graphics are superb and so detailed. Gameplay is easy, although I have to admit it took me a while to realise I could rotate the buildings. Duh! It's a long haul game that I find very relaxing. Yeah, gold takes a while to acquire but you can buy it if desired. It ran okay on my old Tab 3 to start with, but as the game advanced it couldn't cope, so bought a new tablet. Try it and see! I might just have to try some of the other island builders they offer..., Lot better than most city building games, tutorial was very straight forward, and then let you go free unlike so many others. I give thumbs up keep up good work. For gamers, after tutorial island there choice to keep building or continue story... I kind like the game its pretty easy to play unlike so many I have played where restrictions...so thank you developers make easy game to enjoy., Totally luv this game.....and believe it or not,its a game where i dont mind watching an ad...they're not forced upon u,like other games do....i seriously dont mind watching 2 ads at the most (only if u want to)1 ad to speed up the game process for 15mins..2nd ad is to double the outcome/profit from ur buildings for 15 mins....i do both everytime....i know free games like this make it from the ads that are shown ...but well done Sparkling Society,uv created another gud build game with a want for adverts.(i also play another of ur games).i no all free games make they're money from ads..but uv got it right ...oh there is the odd random ad thrown in every now n then..but nothing compared to other games...i just luv the benefits from ur ads...once again well done...👍👍👍, Loved it before update now it will take forever to earn enough money to buy anything and you will have to pay for gold to get anywhere. Also would be nice if you could move stuff to different islands and if there was a collect all. I deleted my other building game because I loved this one, but since update I am looking for new building game. Please undo update., You should be able to collect money when not playing. Collecting in a bank. Put a cap on it depending on how many banks and what level they are. Some places are 51M! NO way are you going to get to that point unless you have no life and play 24/7. Also, when you demolish a property or item, you should get maybe 85% of the cost back, also depending on level. Maybe an automatic collection of money during gameplay. Just a few suggestions., Full of bugs. One task was game speed. I already did click the game speed button and waited for 15mins. Well, it didn't count. Also, the gold coins are too expensive. I would rather buy gems for my mobile legends game than here. Also, logging in to the account keeps on asking to login. Oh before i forget, full of ads. One single click, 5-30secs ads. Omg!, Pretty good game. Very easy and laid back. I was looking for something like Cityville and this is okay. I wish there were missions that gave the game more purpose and challenge. I also really enjoyed how real the buildings in Cityville looked, it made you really WANT the buildings and you'd complete whatever you had to to get them. The buildings in this game are very colorful and cartoon like, so not really my jive. I do like that they periodically give you free tokens if you subscribe., game is nice and the graphics are great. the one thing that REALLY lets it down is that touching any building brings up a menu. so when you're trying to collect funds from the shops you inadvertently almost demolish buildings. this makes the game almost impossible to play on a phone. shame because i like it., UPDATE: as of today..sept 9th level 147 and my game has vanished. I am devistated!!!If you want to see an amazing layout...TaniaS1212 3 place local and 67th place global...600 days of play...my heart is broken. I uninstalled then re installed. My home island is full. All others are locked. My buildings on home island that are upgrading said 601 days to upgrade. ALL of my employees and citizens are still showing..over 23,000!! But has me at level 1 and my $5 plus billion is gone. 😥😣, I really loved this game a lot.many islands are there and we have to explore them it gives us an idea on how to set your house.adorable controls and the graphics are awesome than pubg .the editor us really amazing but the problem is as we built something directly the next level comes and more things to purchase and build you know that's the problem as per me .the ads are awesome as it has many deals and offers . love this game a lot truly and update this version I'll be the first to update.😌👩, Been loving to play this game for months but Im at level 56,, now it all crashed out and back to level 1.

Story has been done to death, no real thinking involved in any of the puzzles, disruptive ads, and the final straw was the scissors part where i knew exactly what to do, used my one free hint to confirm what to do. And still couldn't get the damn game to do it no matter how I tapped. Bah. Not worth your headache., Was excited to play, but KEPT FREEZING every single time it started......uninstalled/reinstalled, STILL didn't work, I think it's a bug with ur music, as soon as it came on it would freeze, and even AFTER I closed it(AND removed from \"tabs\" screen), the music would STILL play....but EITHER WAY, music or not, u lost me before I even got to try, I suppose I'll check back later.....disappointing, Giving it 2 stars because it's a fun game, but so frustrating to play and even if you pay for the answers, those are hardly answers. Lots of bugs in the game too where you just have to get out of the game to keep playing and this is with good Internet and a Samsung ultra s 20, This game is awesome except when I got up to the part where you had to get the tiny metal balls in the holes inside the accordion, some of the balls glitched outside of the accordion then I couldn't progress to the next part and I'm still stuck on that part but overall the game deserves a 5 star rating., Would have been a good game but was over way too quick and you have to pay to play I didn't mind paying 2 euro but I was shocked when it was over so quick a waste of money, Can't progress past the point with the accordion balls. The keep spawning outside the bit with the holes. wast of money., The balancing level, which is like three minutes into gameplay, is absolutely horrendous. Took me about 50 tries and it's not an issue with my phones sensor. Kept shooting off the right side no matter how much I leaned away from it. Lame. But, overall a fun game. Somethings wrong with that bit for sure though. I only got past it by sheer luck., Great puzzles good story line well thought out only one thing your library puzzle was difficult because I didn't have maths skills and little spelling I never leant much at school so in future consider people without education my wife good at spelling and mathematics hope this helps, Out of the ordinary, good challenging puzzles, but worth the clues/answers. Recommended. RonB, The game loads the title screen and plays the music and that is all. Such a shame. Using a Samsung Galaxy S8., The puzzles are sometimes unclear and I've had a few glitches where it should have worked and it just didn't register but still fun, I was enjoying the game and then all of a sudden it just stopped progressing. Not glitched, Not froze, just stopped. You can still hear environmental sounds but there's nothing on screen &amp; if you back out it starts the game over. Damn, that sucks. Could've been a 4 or 5 star!! 2/5, Game is very nice but the promotional approches are very bad because they make us compulsary to buy a hints otherwise game doesn't continue, Graphics are okay but some amof the levels are very slowish and boring as well as confusing , other levels are ok I give props for trying to be a different type of escape game but I feel the need to escape this game because free to play DON'T MEAN pay to play lose people this way even if I wanted to keep playing and pay I wouldn't because this company is false advertising which is not OK., I have completed the game within a day some time it is hard and sometimes it is easy, i give 3 star's because sometimes it doesn't work properly, Overall the game's nice..but.. because of the librarian level I hate this game.. cause that level is almost impossible to complete without some hints... meanwhile.. They'll make us to use the hints many times before reaching the librarian level..I got stuck in the level...so I just uninstalled it....rest is fine about the game, Personally, I had an amazing experience. Some of the puzzles really get you thinking, and I really like the concept. I really like this game!, It a nice gameplay.....its also has hard levels which is good for our mind and sametimes bad too.....this gameplay has really helped me in other ways.......actually there is only one problem which is there is no videos for the hints......this is a issue that i have hope it will be fixed soon.....thanks, Can't get past level 2 once I complete the puzzle nothing happens, and when I use a hint it just gives me the same one every timeI think it would be a fun game if I could get past this gosh darn level,but the only reason I'm not getting past this level is because nothing happens after I've solved it and it's not letting me move, Game is fun but there is a glitch that keeps happening between screen and level changes where the screen goes black and the only remedy is to close the game and reopen. This happens constantly while playing :( If this is fixed I'd happily give more stars!, The game is interesting and nice. It needs to have hints if you get stuck somewhere. I just uninstalled the game because I got stuck at a stage and I Wanted a hint which I couldn't get., Complete trash. Easy puzzles. Dreadful graphics. Painfully slow screen transitions. Also when trying to 'unlock' full game takes you to a scam site and doesn't honor completed 'deals'., Okay this game desereves one star, after 15 minutes of playing it stopped me on the \"Lights out air vent level\" it says that i need to purchase or complete an offer to continue playing, seriously i have never seen such way to force players to pay, worst game, This game is so fun! During this pandemic I find myself bored and I start playing this the only bad thing about this it's the leaning and balancing part, It's impossible to get past the level where you have to carry the supplies to the cells. The hint tells you to lean and balance but doesnt elaborate on how to do that. I was left tapping and swiping around uselessly before ultimately rage quitting., I thought this was a good game but got no hints when needed.. I need hints if I want to play the game. I have to pay cash if I want to get clues. I am not ready to buy clues by paying cash. So I've been reviewing it badly if it's not updated to get the exact hints, Nice game but I don't know why I am getting stuck after I open the ventilator. It's always showing that I have to buy hints. If the developer informs me why this is happening then I'll be very grateful, F- Game gets stuck in ads when u exit ad game goes back to main menu Then you start the game again and the ad starts, then it exits to main menu again CANNOT PLAY THE GAME Also I don't like the nasty ads with people in bed together F-, Great game but the first time I played it I was stuck for like an hour trying to find one final thing until I finally fawnd it and then I still can't get it because it was in the corner where the icons are but it's hard but Great, It wont start.. The game just freezes. Was hella excited, all in vain. Here's your 1 star, It stopped for no reason and wouldn't go any further. I restarted it and it did it again. Waste of a download., Got past first level. Needed to complete offers to continue. Completed offer and still couldn't continue without buying full game. Also too slow paced on loading screens etc, There should be a review number range in the negative spectrum of integers to sufficiently rate this less than zero money grab attempt. You have no shame or guilt. Trash. Trash. Trash. Trash. Trash. You spent time and energy developing Trash instead of attempting to make a one star game. You figured out a formula and dragged what should be an art form straight into the gutter. You are the Santa Claus that smells like liquor and drives an old creepy van with curtains. Trash., I paid money to play the game still shows ads which is insane. A yatzee ad keeps freezing the game up and will not let me go any further no matter what I try., Creative gameplay and cool art, but the game pretty much holds your hand the entire time. The puzzles are rather boring. Then, just as you're avout to escape, the game prompts you to pay to continue or gives you a \"free\" option. The free option requires you to \"complete an offer\" of your choice to continue. But this is NOT FREE. Free means one-way. Free means nothing in return. Giving my information up to a survey site or downloading an app might not cost me money, but neither is really \"free.\", So bad that the game developers make us play other games inbetween and earn the complete game...isn't it too much?? Or else if anyone is frustrated he/she can spend money and buy the full game...I mean common why can't you mention this at the start itself. Pity on you. Never download it., It was an ok game until I reached the payment choice. I wasn't sure if I wanted to pay for a game that was just \"ok\", so I tried the option of downloading one other game and do the achievement, but after 4 days that took me to complete, I couldn't continue Alcatraz, no idea why. It just doesn't accept it that I completed the task. Anyway, after reading a lot of reviews to find a solution (I didn't btw), I think that I shouldn't support that app. There are better escape apps for free/watch adds, Garbage game, it just freezes up. Don't even waste your time downloading it., The gameplay is decent enough so I'm giving two stars, but up to a point I was going to give five. This developer uses the classic strategy of waiting until you've played a fair amount of the game and then blocking you behind a paywall. Alternatively you can fill out few surveys... or so they claim. I jumped through the hoops but it was just another link taking you to the next survey and then the next seemingly forever. Unless you plan on buying it, don't waste your time., Great game but Completely ruined by the half way survey/purchase required to continue.]</td>\n      <td>com.freshgames.escapealcatraz</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>10576 rows × 344 columns</p>\n</div>"

See below for a full list of included content.  Coptic Reader is not simply a text reader but rather it dynamically creates each document/service according to the rites of the current day, or selected day/feast. Coptic Reader builds each document on the fly with all appropriate hymns, rites and instructions to take the guess work out of the order of a church service.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoptic Reader can generate documents in a combination of English, Arabic, and Coptic and supports both English and Arabic as the application interface language. Coptic Reader is fully customizable and allows you to show/hide different liturgical roles (i.e., Priest, Deacon, and Congregation), inaudible prayers, rubrics/comments, and languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may choose between different graphical themes as well as change the document text size. A presentation mode is also supported that allows you to project the content in your church for a complete experience. The application also allows you to control which saint or archangel commemorations will be shown in doxologies, hymns, responses, and other prayers for your church's intercessors.\\r\\n\\r\\nContent List:\\r\\n- Complete Bible including Coptic New Testament and Deuterocanonical books\\r\\n- Book of Hours (Agpeya)\\r\\n- Holy Psalmody including Midnight Praises, Vesper Praises, Morning Praises (Standard, Koiahk, Nativity, Theophany, Great Fast, Pentecostal, including all festal psalies)\\r\\n- Antiphonary (Difnar)\\r\\n- Divine Liturgies with integrated Service of the Deacons (St. Basil, St.Gregory, and St. Cyril, as well as Vespers and Matins service)\\r\\n- Katameros (Sundays, Weekdays, Great Fast, Pentecostal, and feasts)\\r\\n- Synaxarion\\r\\n- Distribution Melodies\\r\\n- Unction of the Sick\\r\\n- Baptism Prayers\\r\\n- Crowning and Engagement Prayers\\r\\n- Pascha Prayers\\r\\n- Prostration Prayers\\r\\n- Liturgy of the Waters (Lakkan)\\r\\n- Veneration\\r\\n- Funerals (Men, Women, Boys, Girls, Monks, Memorials, and Prayer at the Tomb)\\r\\n- Consecrations (Church, Vessels, Censers, Icons, Baptistery, Ordinations, Reception of a New Priest, and Home Blessing)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information about Coptic Reader, visit http://suscopts.org/wiki/Coptic_Reader\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease direct any comments or questions to:\\r\\ncopticreader@suscopts.org\\r\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CopticReader                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \nPlaydox Games                               com.relaxingbraintraining.wordcup         ★★★★★ Word Cooking is FUN and challenging!

Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\\r\\n\\r\\nFEATURES\\r\\n\\r\\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\\r\\n\\r\\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\\r\\n\\r\\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \\r\\n\\r\\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is  masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\\r\\n\\r\\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\\r\\n\\r\\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, what will you serve today?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout Us:\\r\\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Most people are scared of it, but I want to sneak inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are so many rumors, I don’t know what to believe\\r\\n\\r\\nSome kids say the top floor glows at night and that crazy aliens live up there. Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\\r\\n\\r\\nI had to see for myself\\r\\n\\r\\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout Us:\\r\\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Thank you!   \nNick Thissen       nl.nickthissen.iracingforum3    The iR Forum app allows you to access the iRacing forums in a much better way than a mobile browser. Browsing the forums on a mobile browser is found extremely tedious by most people, the pages don't scale well on small screens and links are hard to click, not to mention you constantly have to re-login after a short while. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis app provides a dedicated way to read and write on the forums and even adds some features not available on the forums themselves (such as Favorite threads). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe iR Forum app is iteration 3.0 and has been completely rebuilt from the ground up. It uses the latest Android technologies ensuring much better performance, better integration with recent Android Material Design and just a better experience in general. On top of that, the new app comes with a lot of new features and has been designed from the start to function flawlessly even across flaky internet connections and a (excuse me) rather buggy forum. \\r\\n\\r\\nNew features include:\\r\\n- Login status is automatically refreshed when required, you can continue where you left off seamlessly even after hours of inactivity. \\r\\n- Page loading speed has improved dramatically. On fast internet, average loading times have decreased from ~4 seconds to ~0.5 seconds. \\r\\n- Search the forums with the new search function. \\r\\n- Choose your own theme color including a dark theme for night time reading. \\r\\n- Simple bbcode editor for posting including simple ways to embed images, links and YouTube videos (automatically formatted correctly!). \\r\\n- Post drafts & history - posts are saved even if you don't finish them, so you can come back to finish them later. \\r\\n- Downloading attachments and better handling of images in posts. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE: this app can be used exclusively by active iRacing.com members, you can NOT access the iRacing forums without an active account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nB-hyve             com.orbit.orbitsmarthome        The bhvye smart sprinkler timer app allows you to control or monitor your sprinklers from anywhere in the world with the convenience of your smart device. \\r\\n Smart Watering\\r\\nKnowing how long and how often to water your plants can be challenging.  When set to smart watering mode, b-hyve takes the guesswork out of watering and utilizes Mother Nature, along with some really great technology, to determine the watering schedule for your yard.  When set and left in smart watering mode, b-hyve can save users as much as 50% more water over a traditional controller. \\r\\n\\r\\n Weather\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen set in smart mode, b-hyve uses local weather data to determine how much water is evaporated and transpired through your plants each day to know when it needs to water.  It also accounts for any rainfall that is in the forecast, shuts off the system for rain, then looks back to see how much actually fell.  That’s smart!  But all yards are not the same.  B-hyve also takes into account things like soil type, plant type, sun/shade and slope to determine a watering schedule that takes the water to the roots and helps avoid runoff. \\r\\n\\r\\n WeatherSense\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to be the one in control of the schedule, that’s okay too.  With b-hyve you can set custom programs to water how you want while still taking advantage of the local weather data to override watering in case of a weather event.  This will shut off your system during the rain and resume your program when the rain has passed.  That’s smart!\\r\\n\\r\\nIntegrated Irrigation Audit Tool\\r\\n\\r\\nThe b-hyve app also integrates the award-winning irrigation audit tool right to your smart device.  By performing a catch cup test on your sprinkler system, you will know exactly how much water is being applied rather than relying on estimated sprinkler head water use that other timers/apps use, which can be off by as much as 50%, saving you more water and money.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the app for the best-selling, WaterSense and SWAT certified Orbit B-hyve Smart Wifi Sprinkler Timer.

With the intuitive layout and design of the app, it is fast and easy to connect to any b·hyve Pro controller through WiFi or, if WiFi is not available, directly through Bluetooth right at the timer location.  Once connected to WiFi, b·hyve can be set up in smart mode to assist in delivering the right amount of water to plants, saving clients water and money.\\r\\nThis is the companion App for award-winning b·hyve Pro irrigation controllers. Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the b·hyve App at no charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n***KEY FEATURES***\\r\\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the b·hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the b·hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\\r\\n\\r\\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of b·hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\\r\\n\\r\\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the b·hyve Pro Timer.  In addition to Smart Watering, it incorporates the award-winning catch-cup feature right into the app to deliver up to 25% more water savings over other smart controllers.\\r\\n\\r\\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

Drag letter tiles and make high-scoring words in your tray -- but every move you make has a totally different strategy and goal. \\r\\n\\r\\nEvery level has a matrix of letter tiles, but you can only use the bottom-most set. As you successfully form words, more tiles become uncovered and available to play (the color will change from grey to orange), keeping the gameplay emergent and interesting. Every letter tile has a score on it, and longer words earn you bigger multipliers. Get the right words with the right letters to reach the total score demanded of every level.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the way, you’ll discover amazing power-boosts that can change the shape of each level. There’s the Rocket and Bomb to blow your neighbors away, the Hammer to knock out peksy tiles, the Flipper to turn your whole matrix upside down, and the awesome Golden Wrench which lets you pick any tile as your first letter. Every power-up has the magic to help you clear even the toughest of levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou’ll need a deep vocabulary and keen ability to make your way through the matrix if you want to maximize your score. \\r\\n\\r\\nJoin Felix the Fox in his journey trying to understand oddities of the forest, working his way through surreal lands encompassing the world of the matrix. You and Felix can use your spelling skills to unlock the creative power of language and lift the veil on the very fabric of reality. I know...

Browsing the forums on a mobile browser is found extremely tedious by most people, the pages don't scale well on small screens and links are hard to click, not to mention you constantly have to re-login after a short while. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis app provides a dedicated way to read and write on the forums and even adds some features not available on the forums themselves (such as Favorite threads). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe iR Forum app is iteration 3.0 and has been completely rebuilt from the ground up. It uses the latest Android technologies ensuring much better performance, better integration with recent Android Material Design and just a better experience in general. On top of that, the new app comes with a lot of new features and has been designed from the start to function flawlessly even across flaky internet connections and a (excuse me) rather buggy forum. \\r\\n\\r\\nNew features include:\\r\\n- Login status is automatically refreshed when required, you can continue where you left off seamlessly even after hours of inactivity. \\r\\n- Page loading speed has improved dramatically. On fast internet, average loading times have decreased from ~4 seconds to ~0.5 seconds. \\r\\n- Search the forums with the new search function. \\r\\n- Choose your own theme color including a dark theme for night time reading. \\r\\n- Simple bbcode editor for posting including simple ways to embed images, links and YouTube videos (automatically formatted correctly!). \\r\\n- Post drafts &amp; history - posts are saved even if you don't finish them, so you can come back to finish them later. \\r\\n- Downloading attachments and better handling of images in posts. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE: this app can be used exclusively by active iRacing.com members, you can NOT access the iRacing forums without an active account.</td>\n      <td>19</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\">B-hyve</th>\n      <th>com.orbit.orbitsmarthome</th>\n      <td>Companion app for Orbit bhyve sprinkler timer.</td>\n      <td>The bhvye smart sprinkler timer app allows you to control or monitor your sprinklers from anywhere in the world with the convenience of your smart device. \\r\\n Smart Watering\\r\\nKnowing how long and how often to water your plants can be challenging.  When set to smart watering mode, b-hyve takes the guesswork out of watering and utilizes Mother Nature, along with some really great technology, to determine the watering schedule for your yard.  When set and left in smart watering mode, b-hyve can save users as much as 50% more water over a traditional controller. \\r\\n\\r\\n Weather\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen set in smart mode, b-hyve uses local weather data to determine how much water is evaporated and transpired through your plants each day to know when it needs to water.  It also accounts for any rainfall that is in the forecast, shuts off the system for rain, then looks back to see how much actually fell.  That’s smart!  But all yards are not the same.  B-hyve also takes into account things like soil type, plant type, sun/shade and slope to determine a watering schedule that takes the water to the roots and helps avoid runoff. \\r\\n\\r\\n WeatherSense\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to be the one in control of the schedule, that’s okay too.  With b-hyve you can set custom programs to water how you want while still taking advantage of the local weather data to override watering in case of a weather event.  This will shut off your system during the rain and resume your program when the rain has passed.  That’s smart!\\r\\n\\r\\nIntegrated Irrigation Audit Tool\\r\\n\\r\\nThe b-hyve app also integrates the award-winning irrigation audit tool right to your smart device.  By performing a catch cup test on your sprinkler system, you will know exactly how much water is being applied rather than relying on estimated sprinkler head water use that other timers/apps use, which can be off by as much as 50%, saving you more water and money.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the app for the best-selling, WaterSense and SWAT certified Orbit B-hyve Smart Wifi Sprinkler Timer.  This is also the companion app for homeowners to the Hydro-Rain B-hyve Pro Wifi Controller. \\r\\nPlease let us know if you have questions or problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the b·hyve App at no charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n***KEY FEATURES***\\r\\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the b·hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the b·hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\\r\\n\\r\\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of b·hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\\r\\n\\r\\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the b·hyve Pro Timer.

Drag letter tiles and make high-scoring words in your tray -- but every move you make has a totally different strategy and goal. \\r\\n\\r\\nEvery level has a matrix of letter tiles, but you can only use the bottom-most set. As you successfully form words, more tiles become uncovered and available to play (the color will change from grey to orange), keeping the gameplay emergent and interesting. Every letter tile has a score on it, and longer words earn you bigger multipliers. Get the right words with the right letters to reach the total score demanded of every level.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the way, you’ll discover amazing power-boosts that can change the shape of each level. There’s the Rocket and Bomb to blow your neighbors away, the Hammer to knock out peksy tiles, the Flipper to turn your whole matrix upside down, and the awesome Golden Wrench which lets you pick any tile as your first letter. Every power-up has the magic to help you clear even the toughest of levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou’ll need a deep vocabulary and keen ability to make your way through the matrix if you want to maximize your score. \\r\\n\\r\\nJoin Felix the Fox in his journey trying to understand oddities of the forest, working his way through surreal lands encompassing the world of the matrix.
