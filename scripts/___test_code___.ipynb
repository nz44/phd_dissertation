See below for a full list of included content.  Coptic Reader is not simply a text reader but rather it dynamically creates each document/service according to the rites of the current day, or selected day/feast. Coptic Reader builds each document on the fly with all appropriate hymns, rites and instructions to take the guess work out of the order of a church service.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoptic Reader can generate documents in a combination of English, Arabic, and Coptic and supports both English and Arabic as the application interface language. Coptic Reader is fully customizable and allows you to show/hide different liturgical roles (i.e., Priest, Deacon, and Congregation), inaudible prayers, rubrics/comments, and languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may choose between different graphical themes as well as change the document text size. A presentation mode is also supported that allows you to project the content in your church for a complete experience. The application also allows you to control which saint or archangel commemorations will be shown in doxologies, hymns, responses, and other prayers for your church's intercessors.\\r\\n\\r\\nContent List:\\r\\n- Complete Bible including Coptic New Testament and Deuterocanonical books\\r\\n- Book of Hours (Agpeya)\\r\\n- Holy Psalmody including Midnight Praises, Vesper Praises, Morning Praises (Standard, Koiahk, Nativity, Theophany, Great Fast, Pentecostal, including all festal psalies)\\r\\n- Antiphonary (Difnar)\\r\\n- Divine Liturgies with integrated Service of the Deacons (St. Basil, St.Gregory, and St. Cyril, as well as Vespers and Matins service)\\r\\n- Katameros (Sundays, Weekdays, Great Fast, Pentecostal, and feasts)\\r\\n- Synaxarion\\r\\n- Distribution Melodies\\r\\n- Unction of the Sick\\r\\n- Baptism Prayers\\r\\n- Crowning and Engagement Prayers\\r\\n- Pascha Prayers\\r\\n- Prostration Prayers\\r\\n- Liturgy of the Waters (Lakkan)\\r\\n- Veneration\\r\\n- Funerals (Men, Women, Boys, Girls, Monks, Memorials, and Prayer at the Tomb)\\r\\n- Consecrations (Church, Vessels, Censers, Icons, Baptistery, Ordinations, Reception of a New Priest, and Home Blessing)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information about Coptic Reader, visit http://suscopts.org/wiki/Coptic_Reader\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease direct any comments or questions to:\\r\\ncopticreader@suscopts.org\\r\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CopticReader                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \nPlaydox Games                               com.relaxingbraintraining.wordcup         ★★★★★ Word Cooking is FUN and challenging!

Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\\r\\n\\r\\nFEATURES\\r\\n\\r\\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\\r\\n\\r\\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\\r\\n\\r\\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \\r\\n\\r\\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is  masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\\r\\n\\r\\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\\r\\n\\r\\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, what will you serve today?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout Us:\\r\\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Most people are scared of it, but I want to sneak inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are so many rumors, I don’t know what to believe\\r\\n\\r\\nSome kids say the top floor glows at night and that crazy aliens live up there. Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\\r\\n\\r\\nI had to see for myself\\r\\n\\r\\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout Us:\\r\\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Thank you!   \nNick Thissen       nl.nickthissen.iracingforum3    The iR Forum app allows you to access the iRacing forums in a much better way than a mobile browser. Browsing the forums on a mobile browser is found extremely tedious by most people, the pages don't scale well on small screens and links are hard to click, not to mention you constantly have to re-login after a short while. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis app provides a dedicated way to read and write on the forums and even adds some features not available on the forums themselves (such as Favorite threads). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe iR Forum app is iteration 3.0 and has been completely rebuilt from the ground up. It uses the latest Android technologies ensuring much better performance, better integration with recent Android Material Design and just a better experience in general. On top of that, the new app comes with a lot of new features and has been designed from the start to function flawlessly even across flaky internet connections and a (excuse me) rather buggy forum. \\r\\n\\r\\nNew features include:\\r\\n- Login status is automatically refreshed when required, you can continue where you left off seamlessly even after hours of inactivity. \\r\\n- Page loading speed has improved dramatically. On fast internet, average loading times have decreased from ~4 seconds to ~0.5 seconds. \\r\\n- Search the forums with the new search function. \\r\\n- Choose your own theme color including a dark theme for night time reading. \\r\\n- Simple bbcode editor for posting including simple ways to embed images, links and YouTube videos (automatically formatted correctly!). \\r\\n- Post drafts & history - posts are saved even if you don't finish them, so you can come back to finish them later. \\r\\n- Downloading attachments and better handling of images in posts. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE: this app can be used exclusively by active iRacing.com members, you can NOT access the iRacing forums without an active account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nB-hyve             com.orbit.orbitsmarthome        The bhvye smart sprinkler timer app allows you to control or monitor your sprinklers from anywhere in the world with the convenience of your smart device. \\r\\n Smart Watering\\r\\nKnowing how long and how often to water your plants can be challenging.  When set to smart watering mode, b-hyve takes the guesswork out of watering and utilizes Mother Nature, along with some really great technology, to determine the watering schedule for your yard.  When set and left in smart watering mode, b-hyve can save users as much as 50% more water over a traditional controller. \\r\\n\\r\\n Weather\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen set in smart mode, b-hyve uses local weather data to determine how much water is evaporated and transpired through your plants each day to know when it needs to water.  It also accounts for any rainfall that is in the forecast, shuts off the system for rain, then looks back to see how much actually fell.  That’s smart!  But all yards are not the same.  B-hyve also takes into account things like soil type, plant type, sun/shade and slope to determine a watering schedule that takes the water to the roots and helps avoid runoff. \\r\\n\\r\\n WeatherSense\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to be the one in control of the schedule, that’s okay too.  With b-hyve you can set custom programs to water how you want while still taking advantage of the local weather data to override watering in case of a weather event.  This will shut off your system during the rain and resume your program when the rain has passed.  That’s smart!\\r\\n\\r\\nIntegrated Irrigation Audit Tool\\r\\n\\r\\nThe b-hyve app also integrates the award-winning irrigation audit tool right to your smart device.  By performing a catch cup test on your sprinkler system, you will know exactly how much water is being applied rather than relying on estimated sprinkler head water use that other timers/apps use, which can be off by as much as 50%, saving you more water and money.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the app for the best-selling, WaterSense and SWAT certified Orbit B-hyve Smart Wifi Sprinkler Timer.

With the intuitive layout and design of the app, it is fast and easy to connect to any b·hyve Pro controller through WiFi or, if WiFi is not available, directly through Bluetooth right at the timer location.  Once connected to WiFi, b·hyve can be set up in smart mode to assist in delivering the right amount of water to plants, saving clients water and money.\\r\\nThis is the companion App for award-winning b·hyve Pro irrigation controllers. Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the b·hyve App at no charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n***KEY FEATURES***\\r\\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the b·hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the b·hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\\r\\n\\r\\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of b·hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\\r\\n\\r\\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the b·hyve Pro Timer.  In addition to Smart Watering, it incorporates the award-winning catch-cup feature right into the app to deliver up to 25% more water savings over other smart controllers.\\r\\n\\r\\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

Drag letter tiles and make high-scoring words in your tray -- but every move you make has a totally different strategy and goal. \\r\\n\\r\\nEvery level has a matrix of letter tiles, but you can only use the bottom-most set. As you successfully form words, more tiles become uncovered and available to play (the color will change from grey to orange), keeping the gameplay emergent and interesting. Every letter tile has a score on it, and longer words earn you bigger multipliers. Get the right words with the right letters to reach the total score demanded of every level.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the way, you’ll discover amazing power-boosts that can change the shape of each level. There’s the Rocket and Bomb to blow your neighbors away, the Hammer to knock out peksy tiles, the Flipper to turn your whole matrix upside down, and the awesome Golden Wrench which lets you pick any tile as your first letter. Every power-up has the magic to help you clear even the toughest of levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou’ll need a deep vocabulary and keen ability to make your way through the matrix if you want to maximize your score. \\r\\n\\r\\nJoin Felix the Fox in his journey trying to understand oddities of the forest, working his way through surreal lands encompassing the world of the matrix. You and Felix can use your spelling skills to unlock the creative power of language and lift the veil on the very fabric of reality. I know...

Browsing the forums on a mobile browser is found extremely tedious by most people, the pages don't scale well on small screens and links are hard to click, not to mention you constantly have to re-login after a short while. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis app provides a dedicated way to read and write on the forums and even adds some features not available on the forums themselves (such as Favorite threads). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe iR Forum app is iteration 3.0 and has been completely rebuilt from the ground up. It uses the latest Android technologies ensuring much better performance, better integration with recent Android Material Design and just a better experience in general. On top of that, the new app comes with a lot of new features and has been designed from the start to function flawlessly even across flaky internet connections and a (excuse me) rather buggy forum. \\r\\n\\r\\nNew features include:\\r\\n- Login status is automatically refreshed when required, you can continue where you left off seamlessly even after hours of inactivity. \\r\\n- Page loading speed has improved dramatically. On fast internet, average loading times have decreased from ~4 seconds to ~0.5 seconds. \\r\\n- Search the forums with the new search function. \\r\\n- Choose your own theme color including a dark theme for night time reading. \\r\\n- Simple bbcode editor for posting including simple ways to embed images, links and YouTube videos (automatically formatted correctly!). \\r\\n- Post drafts &amp; history - posts are saved even if you don't finish them, so you can come back to finish them later. \\r\\n- Downloading attachments and better handling of images in posts. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE: this app can be used exclusively by active iRacing.com members, you can NOT access the iRacing forums without an active account.</td>\n      <td>19</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\">B-hyve</th>\n      <th>com.orbit.orbitsmarthome</th>\n      <td>Companion app for Orbit bhyve sprinkler timer.</td>\n      <td>The bhvye smart sprinkler timer app allows you to control or monitor your sprinklers from anywhere in the world with the convenience of your smart device. \\r\\n Smart Watering\\r\\nKnowing how long and how often to water your plants can be challenging.  When set to smart watering mode, b-hyve takes the guesswork out of watering and utilizes Mother Nature, along with some really great technology, to determine the watering schedule for your yard.  When set and left in smart watering mode, b-hyve can save users as much as 50% more water over a traditional controller. \\r\\n\\r\\n Weather\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen set in smart mode, b-hyve uses local weather data to determine how much water is evaporated and transpired through your plants each day to know when it needs to water.  It also accounts for any rainfall that is in the forecast, shuts off the system for rain, then looks back to see how much actually fell.  That’s smart!  But all yards are not the same.  B-hyve also takes into account things like soil type, plant type, sun/shade and slope to determine a watering schedule that takes the water to the roots and helps avoid runoff. \\r\\n\\r\\n WeatherSense\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to be the one in control of the schedule, that’s okay too.  With b-hyve you can set custom programs to water how you want while still taking advantage of the local weather data to override watering in case of a weather event.  This will shut off your system during the rain and resume your program when the rain has passed.  That’s smart!\\r\\n\\r\\nIntegrated Irrigation Audit Tool\\r\\n\\r\\nThe b-hyve app also integrates the award-winning irrigation audit tool right to your smart device.  By performing a catch cup test on your sprinkler system, you will know exactly how much water is being applied rather than relying on estimated sprinkler head water use that other timers/apps use, which can be off by as much as 50%, saving you more water and money.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the app for the best-selling, WaterSense and SWAT certified Orbit B-hyve Smart Wifi Sprinkler Timer.  This is also the companion app for homeowners to the Hydro-Rain B-hyve Pro Wifi Controller. \\r\\nPlease let us know if you have questions or problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

Get the right words with the right letters to reach the total score demanded of every level.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the way, you’ll discover amazing power-boosts that can change the shape of each level. There’s the Rocket and Bomb to blow your neighbors away, the Hammer to knock out peksy tiles, the Flipper to turn your whole matrix upside down, and the awesome Golden Wrench which lets you pick any tile as your first letter. Every power-up has the magic to help you clear even the toughest of levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou’ll need a deep vocabulary and keen ability to make your way through the matrix if you want to maximize your score. \\r\\n\\r\\nJoin Felix the Fox in his journey trying to understand oddities of the forest, working his way through surreal lands encompassing the world of the matrix.
