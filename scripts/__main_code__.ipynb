      "comments  :  ['Helpful tool for quitting smoking. Keeps track of $ saved, cigarettes passed, health/ life regained, full of helpful hints, tips and support. The app could use some more games in the \"beat an urge\" section, but otherwise, it\\'s perfect. Actually, given the fact that it\\'s free, I can\\'t even complain about the game experience.', \"I like the app. Useful info, encouragement to keep going, a matching game to kill time and keep track of how many times you used it to beat a craving. I only downloaded this as a random tracker to keep tabs of how long I've gone without a cigarette but I find myself using it much more than I planned.\", \"Is a great app packed with every help available. I like the smoke free timer, the game, the reward yourself counter. And it explain how your health improves as you continue smoke free. I opened it every day to see how my health is improving. I am very satisfied with this app, I am using bupropion, nicotine patches and this app to give myself a better chance at succeed, so far I'm doing good taking it one day at a time and not thinking ahead. Good luck to all that are trying to kick this bad habi\", \"Like a positive, supportive friend available whenever you need it. Tracks the $ you save, how much each body system is improving as time goes on, motivators, triggers, etc. Even has a little game you can play to distract you during a craving. I can't think of a better app to keep you motivated during the struggle of quitting smoking!\", \"Really helpful and makes you feel rewarded and accomplished each day with all the health statistics and money savings. The ads suck though and make the app kind of a data sink, so make sure it isn't running in the background all the time. Otherwise it's awesome and I really am grateful for it's existence, especially for free.\", \"Very encouraging to keep the non-smoking streak going when you can literally see how long you've been smoke free, how many cigarettes you would have smoked in that time, how much money you're saving, how your mental and physical health improves over time, how to distract yourself from cravings, and there are even tips for dealing with triggers and cravings, an option to stop smoking slowly instead of cold turkey, and a way to track and stay inspired even if you slip up and sneak a cigarette.\", 'I think it\\'s exactly the stats and info I want to see when choosing a smoking app. Ads aren\\'t as bad as some but I would prefer there to be none. I guess, \"how do you make money\"--on a free app--should be the question. Anyway, worth downloading.', \"Great app to keep you motivated making progress & milestones. Several of the more important features, however, provide diversions to get through cravings as well as the information needed to keep one focused. And it's free!!! Thanks for an amazing app\", \"Good to help motivate and keep track of money saved and how many cigarettes not smoked. Game to take your mind offa craving is a match them game and does help. Only improvement needed is the quit slowly option doesn't integrate so if you put a quit date and use the quit slowly simultaneously they don't talk to each other.\", \"Fab!! I'm 1 day & 11 hours in which is a huge thing for me. I almost gave in a couple of times yesterday but the app really helped distract me & I truly didn't want to let the app down as silly as that sounds. I'm really impressed with it so far\", \"I've tried several app, but this is the best one! It's very detailed about how many sigaretts and money you have saved after quitting. It describes also all the benefits for your body after each day. I feel this app is very motivating and helpful!\", 'Makes it easier. Ive been smoking for almost 17 years and finally decided to quit for good. Cold turkey at that. This app gives different ways to track your bodys healing and recovering stages after quitting which gives me goals to reach on top of the actual goals to reach. Great app. Strongly recommend. 3 days with no cigs and no plans of picking up another.', \"I really liked the quit slowly function until I reached my quit date. Now along with keeping track of how long it's been, it keeps track of how much money I'm saving, but also let's me know how my health improves.\", 'Like it. Lots of variety for info, badges, achievements, and distractions. My only wish is that there could be more than one treat reward option at a time (I like having several listed that I can watch and look forward to achieving). Lose 1 point for that only. 😊', \"I like the app because it is my first experience with anything of the sort when it comes to addiction. I read materials, then found this app and find it to be useful. There's no explanation on how to use it successfully, but I find the match game helpful and the awards appealing.\", 'This has been an immensely helpful and rewarding app. It has been great to keep track of the many impacts quitting comes with, financial & health wise. Highly recommend this comprehensive support!', \"This app has given me the incentive to stay off the cigs watching my time smoke free and my money saved increase really helps. The pairs game to help with cravings isn't the best game but it did help, it was a distraction that at times was necessary. Have recommended this app to others\", 'It is so hard to quit smoking. Seeing your progress on the app really helps! One issue I have found is the memory game, it makes me want to smoke sometimes.', \"This is a great app. I'm using patches to quit and this app is a great secondary product to aid in quitting. So many tabs and options to give lots of data that shows your progress which gives inspiration to keep going. Defo recommend\", \"This app is very user friendly and gives me the info and encouragement that I need to once and for all quit killing myself by smoking! I like how it shows how many cigarettes I've not smoked, and how much money I'm actually saving. I highly recommend this app if you struggle to give smoking up.\", \"I like this app the best compared to others I've tried, really handy 'quit slowly' feature as I cant go cold turkey. 4 stars as I havent got premium so cant say what that's like but over all one of the best apps for checking your progress.\", 'This app was the one that ACTUALLY helped me quit, I love the badges and health facts that tell me whats better about my health with my amount of time smoke free. I also loved the game to beat urges. This app really helped with my willpower to quit depending on nicotine. Definitely recommend!!', \"Just starting to use this app. The concentration game used to distract you from smoking a cigarette is awesome. Just the fact that this app has a handy distraction is key. Haven't seen this in any other quit smoking app so far. Its helped me HUGE.\", 'I like the app but I think it would do better if it had notifications on the top of my screen for quicker access it would be easier than looking for the app to input details', \"I love the counter which I've put on my homescreen so I keep an eye on my progress of how many days smoke free. The longer you remain smoke free then the more badges you own. The worst part for me is that before I gave up smoking, I smoked tobacco. The settings make it incredibly difficult to work out how much I've saved (money) and how many cigs I've passed on since quitting. So this app is perfect for those who smoke actual cigarettes and not rollies.\", \"Brilliant! I literally couldn't have successfully stopped smoking without it. It's fantastic motivation to be able to easily track how much money I've saved and what health benefits I've gained back! 💪🏻🚭\", \"A nice simple app that has everything I need to support me through the rough patches. I like the all the stats you get like how much money you have saved and how many cigarettes you didn't smoke.\", 'This app is awesome. Ive been smoke free for 10 days. I love seeing how much money I saved. I continue to check and see where my health is. Its nice earning badges for my progress it keeps me motivated.', 'Very helpful!! All the information and little rewards are supportive. Innovative ways to help get over cravings.', \"Absoutly love this app. I quit the day before I started using it. It really helps put things into perspective and helps give me strenght to get passed my cravings. I saw other quit smoking apps but I'm glad I choose this one.\", \"This app is great, it's a summary of what I have accomplished and shows me what to look forward to and when to expect the results. Great tool for those who want to quit, it sure helped me out!\", 'Its helping but I cant use it on my long drives because it is not hands free. Which when I smoke cigarettes the most. I went a whole 20 hrs without a smoke but also the slow quitting section does not have enough support or optional.', \"Its day 365 of not smoking :D this app was great especially in the first few days. I love the cash counter and live gained. If it could be improved I think the app could look better (it's a bit windows xp)\", 'Great app! It rewards you and provides information that makes it easier to keep going!!', \"Love this app,I'm 48 days smoke free and I believe this app is helping in its own way,I like stats and this app gives loads to keep me spurred on to keep away from the dreaded ciggies.\", \"I have used it for 4 days and I really enjoy the app. I have remained smoke free. I used the quit slowly setting and I read the info to keep myself busy when I'm having a craving. Really great app. Thanks so much for this app. This is the longest I've been smoke free in 11 years. I enjoy looking at my health stats and trophies, they motivate me!\", \"I think this is really helpful. It's something else to focus on. Very few ads and nice tracking system.\", 'So far its a cool app. You get to see how much money you spend on cigarettes daily which is a big contributor in keeping me motivated. It will work for you just start now.', 'Really great job on the GAME and the COLOURS and the amount of great INFORMATION on a single page. I really love this app.', \"Real nice app. Don't wanna curse it but I've been almost two days smoke free and I'm gonna keep it this way. The app is nice with the memory puzzle which helps when craving. Lots of medical benefits are shown and motivate me. They are tracked and show you how long it takes after your last smoke. Rly just a very nice app I reccomend it to anyone trying to quit.\"]\n",

      "comments  :  [\"Great app, my only lssue is it doesn't save the page you are reading and defaults to the first comic in the library when the app is reopened\", 'Having the title and folder count on the covers is busy and difficult to read. Moving that info to below the image would improve it dramatically.', 'This was my favorite comic viewing app, but trying to zoom in (for example, on double pages, which are downscaled to fill the screen) will result in extremely degraded and pixelated images, rendering some books unreadable no matter what you do. The option to display images in high resolution does not work and reverts back to \"medium\" (in reality, extremely low) quality as soon as you exit the app. It\\'s perfect in every other way, but this bug is serious enough to break the entire experience.', \"After some settings it functions perfectly, no quality issues. (If you encountered any low res problems, go through the options again and try different parameters.) Oh and no annoying ads, it's a pro.\", \"It's altogether a good app, very clean and the page fills up the whole screen nicely, very easy to use. I'm knocking off two stars, because it does not read .rar/.cbr files, though it says in the description that the app does read .rar. All my files with that extension just won't read, and it's extremely bothersome that I always have to check and convert.\", 'Fast all-in-one viewer. Read all formats. It would be great if you add more color themes for epub files. Also, adding tap zones with horizontal and vertical scrooling will improve reading. Otherwise, there are no weak sides of this app. Thanks.', 'A simpe viewer with plenty of options to tinker with and does what it\\'s supposed to do: display comics/mangas with a few clicks. Minor feature request: I\\'d like the \"continue reading\" button on the library view + the list of books I already started to read, as that information seems to be already cached.', \"i don't need to say anything.. This app is just perfect, it also has no ads at all, which is perfect. Feature suggestion : add last page action, delete the comic.. you know, to save some space..i hope the dev team can implement it in the near future\", \"Great viewer, been enjoying for many years. Encountering a bug with auto loading of .rar files, where it won't automatically reload after the app cold boots. Tried all the different settings. What's annoying is it will auto load properly if you back to home and reopen it, so it's purely a bug.\", \"I really love this comic viewer above all the rest I've tried. Just an FYI, though. It seems that if your phone is rooted, root access must be hidden. Otherwise, Challenger kept freezing my phone when I tried to add folders to the library. Strange.\", \"My favorite cbr reader... until now. The latest update seems to have broken something. The app does not display anything and is not responding. Please fix this issue, this is my favorite cbr reader, I don't want to change 😥\", 'Great app. Really like the many options and the widget is amazing. Only problem I found is that everytime I move on zoom pages are turned. Is there any way to not turn page with zoom on? Thank you.', \"This is one of the few viewer on Android that supports cb7. However, I can only open files from within the app. Can't use this app to open files on a file explorer app.\", \"It's so easy to set this app I'm your favorite reading mode. I've tried other options and it is the best.\", \"Perfect. Minus 1 * for contacts permission... Don't understand why this is necessary. Also can't disable this.\", \"this has been my default choice over several years and multiple tablets. It's great for sorting titles, has good utility for reference books in PDF format.\", 'Great little app for reading comics on the move, quick to setup and easy to use. Definitely my reader of choice.', 'Other comic book readers waste your time with ads. This does not. It even has better features! Five stars!', \"It's great when it work but when open web comic that single image has super long length, the simply render the image at lowest quality making it unreadable even I already max all setting\", 'Good app. But the screen auto rotates while reading which is a bit annoying. Is there any way to turn out off?', \"Crashing on my note 4, I was going to put a 5 star review but after that problem it's totally useless, It's crashing as soon as I open it.\", \"The old version was better, i just updated the new version and now i can't open ANY of my files..what the hell!! 😑😠\", 'I ask for better res thumbnail for the bookmarks on folders, at least as good as the thumbnail in the library.', 'Since this last update i want to open the app and shutdown itself, please fix this thank you.', \"Tried 3 apps, this was the fastest. Don't let the simple ui fool you, it's a powerhouse!\", 'Very bad updation . File not open,', \"This app has followed me over to a new phone 4 times now because it's the best comic reader I've found. After a recent update it stopped working with 1 type of archive so I contacted the developer and exchanged a few emails - the problem was fixed and updated in less that 48 hours - amazing for a free programme.\", 'While the looks are definitely not as shiny and modern as one might expect, the functionality of this application blows the competition out of the water. If you are looking far a comic viewer that handels any and all filetypes, this is the one to get.', \"Great app, which allows the user to personalize and tweak as much as possible until they find the right fit. Sadly, after a week using it, I must say it wasn't for me. Regardless, I encourage anyone to give it a shot, it's worth your time.\", 'this app needs needs to give some tutorial to read with the source from web, (well the web address could be hidden). for incomplete source file, like 1chapter per file, it needs some kind of next chapter function (button) at the end of the page.', 'Variety of extension can be opened with this app, but low quality viewer, I tried what the developer said about bitmap quality, but nothing improved, then I compare pdf file using normal pdf reader and challenger viewer, it was obvious the the reader is way clearer than the this app by mile.', 'It is very reliable but lately it has been showing my library in double. Not sure why. Going to try to reinstall. There should be a few more perks added to it to make it better. Like a guided view would be cool. Not sure what else to round it off, maybe some updated feel to the user interface; then it has the potential to be the best comic reading app. I would even pay or donate for an improved version', 'Very good little reader, lots of potential. A pity there are a few bugs/flaws remaining and no updates since 2017. Still, you won\\'t find a better _free_ comic/manga reader with so much flexibility. PS: To the developer, I can translate to Afrikaans and correct the errors in the English version. If you\\'d like, just reply to the review and I\\'ll mail you back. Otherwise, I\\'ll assume that\\'s a \"no thanks\".', 'More features are required. No table of contents (a huge time saver especially in large omnibus files containing entire runs of comics) for quickly navigating chapters. Works with all files I\\'ve tried so far. Loading times could be better. The \"go to\" feature is fair but the page numbers are imposed over the pages as you scroll. Fast scrolling blurs the page number so overshooting the desired page happens frequently.', '\"Google drive\" is hidden behind \"Open Web\". Google Drive is not a website. I never tried it since I wasn\\'t trying to open a comic from a website, but rather from my drive. There are a number of very, very basic UI expectations which are hidden; to select a directory to upload to a new comic book library, you have to long-select any individual file in the directory you wish to add and wait for a pop-up to ask you if you want to use the whole directory.  The app is functional but has some fundamental UI/UX issues.', \"Not possible to zoom. Very frustrating. Googling and cycling through the menu with its advance/basic toggle... No pinch nor double tap zoom. It does work on my Note8. But not my Samsung J3 Emerge. Eboox works good though... This is my go to reader when it does work. On my Note8 it's my favorite. But for books on my son's phone I am so frustrated trying to dig through settings and google to find how to zoom, just doesn't work.\", \"So here i had this 600 chapter collection of a comic, trying to convert each to one cbz then to movi for kindle (phone) after numerous tries, gave up, searchex, found a few apps, didn't like em, specially popup ads. Searched, found this, tried, the comics are neatly stacked. If at all, i have one suggestion though, if detailed mode (list view than grid view) could be enabled. If a file's name is too long it doesn't show it completely..\", \"Edit1: Thanks for the quick reply! Ah, I see! It wasn't under the your long-press action set. I now have it set to double-tap. My main qualm is fixed!  Back to five stars with ye! As for the other issue: when I finish reading a file and continue on to the next one, then later return to the library, I sometimes find that what I've read isn't marked read and greyed out. So, it is in my nature to mark it unread then mark it read again so that it's greyed out. I use the folder library display mode, if that influences things.  This is absolutely the best, most robust application of its type on the Play Store - and, I thank you for creating it. But, I'm going to be greedy and add a few things to my wishlist. 1) Individual folder actions, so that I can mark folders read from one level above the actual files and/or move them to a separate area whence read. 2) 2-page fill-screen mode. So that I can force single pages to display in one half of the display. Traditional comics look fine, with a sliver extra... but, some widescreen European comics look odd, with only one and half pages shown. 3) A favorites or to-read tag.\", \"I've been using it since I switched to android 5 years ago or so and it has been perfect until about 2 month ago (maybe around 2/01/19) when little bugs started happening... now android rolled out PIE OS and I'm getting a message that this app was written for an older version of android so, hmmmmm.\", 'Ive tried 5 or 6 Other comic viewer apps and this is the ONLY ONE ive found where i can load my Own digital collection. Unfortunately the Only single problem i have is while in the middle of reading a comic it will revert back to the menu screen...thankfully hitting the load last viewed file takes me back where inwas but it happens a dozen or so times Per comic. (Reading on a brand new Asus zen note) if that problem were corrected this app would be a Perfect 5 star']\n",

      "comments  :  ['So far this app is amazing. I was having a hard time finding an app like this. I use to use another shipping track app and it was forcing to go premium and would only do one package at a time and if you have more than one you have to upgrade. Also most of the time they could never find my package and who the carrier was for the package. Anyways so far love this app! Keep you updated if anything changes.', 'One of the best All Around shipping trackers I have used. It covers nearly every Postal Service in the world as well as most if not all the major and many minor non-governmental shipping and delivery companies used. Cut and paste tracking number straight from AliExpress and Ebay and track multiple shipments from multiple sources all in a simple elegant interface. Lastly language changes and translation service ( at least for English ) is an option.', 'It seemed like it was taking a long time to receive my package so I emailed the company a f they responded right back with a tracking number. I downloaded the app andThey kept me updated me on where my package was regularly until it reached my doorstep. Really appreciated that. Have me confidence about my order. Would order from them again...just need to be patient.', \"This app is great if you have shipping coming from overseas. It notify's you of your shipments progress all the way. There is a memo section on the application.\", \"This is a great app! Yet i still have trouble with getting my notifications right away that's the only down fall other than that its perfect! Would recommend! I actually got my packages.\", 'Fix the status bar and navigation bar colour in light mode. The new widget is very nice, you should make the other widget with rounded corners as well.', \"Amazing tracking app. Especially around this time of year when I've packages coming from various sites, this consolidates all tracking numbers into one app. If you copy a tracking number from an email, etc, this app will auto-detect it upon launching, and will give you updated tracking movements throughout the shipping process. Very easy to use, 100% recommended!\", 'Love this Application!! It give both information from parcel destination/departure country. Make my parcel tracking much easier :D', 'This app makes it really easy to track all my packages from one app... but it would be nice if it could track package shipped with amazons delivery service as well', 'Sometimes has difficulty sourcing tracking numbers, but most of the time it works terrifically well.', 'This has been such a useful tool. Was able to track a package shipped from Russia so I was never in the dark on where it was in the process. Also much more detailed information on tracking than most of the basic tracking information you receive on your purchases. DHL had such vague info when they \"missent\" a package. This app let me know exactly where it was. Love it', 'Excellent , did a good job of keeping me informed where my items were and when they would be delivered', 'Love this, especially the excellent translation software. Very pleased.', 'Great app! Love using it for all of my deliveries! Love the note/memo feature too.', \"Useful app, BUT with delays. Found that the tracking feature is delayed for some carriers. Checked on official website that my package is already on delivery with the latest update on 9 AM but at the same time 17TRACK shows that it is still in transit and latest update is on 2 AM. Kinda frustrating because this happens almost everytime. Still give it 3-star because it's free with no annoying ads or ridiculous tracking limits.\", 'Pretty nice and definitely useful app! Here\\'s a suggestion on how to make even better: display \"memo\" instead of the tracking number in the notifications. It would be more user friendly to see a notification saying \"Tracking updates available for your DJI Mavic\", instead of \"Tracking updates available for your package XX..............ZZ\"', \"I have items shipped from all over the world for my various airsoft/RC hobbies etc and tracking was always an issue until I found this app. Since installing it, I've had at least 20 items delivered all with correct up to date tracking info, that stays up to date. I haven't used any other shopping tracking software/app because this covers every single base!!\", \"Previously gave 5 * but I recently ordered 12 different items on Ali Express and the app gives me an error message on all 12 tracking numbers. It says number can't be found at the moment. I tried other tracking methods and the number was foundbon all 12 tracking numbers. Unfortunately at the moment this app seems to be useless at tracking orders so I had to reduce my rating from 5* to 1* would give it 0* if I could as it does not seem to work for active tracking numbers .\", 'Track all your packages from different carriers at the same time & place! Updates are sometimes a little late in comparison to the actual carrier website. They might appear only a few hours later in the app even when refreshing, so I removed 1 star for now.', 'Works as well as it can. However, the world of logistics (especially postal services) are still quite a mystery to figure out, which often leads to 17track not being able to give us full information on deliveries. For example, everything sent by DHL tells me that they tried to deliver the item but it was unsuccessful etc. When this happens I just contact my local post office and get directions from there. However, keeping track of the parcel on its journey to my country is flawless.', 'Tracks packages across services by simply \"pasting\" a number! It can automatically detect the carrier or you can select from a list if you didn\\'t have any luck the first time. Works perfectly for what I wanted! I wish it could track packages shipped through Amazon Logistics.', \"This is basically the premier package tracking app that is just missing a few obvious features. It is able to figure out (or at least provide options for) what the carrier is, and supports a wide amount of carriers (including those pesky eBay Global Shipping and AliExpress tracking numbers). It doesn't show you the expected delivery date, which is something most other tracking apps easily provide. You can't easily sort the entries by date, either. But other than that it's the best tracking app.\", 'Great app, if you need to track many parcels in on app this is the right choice.', \"Very useful, no ads makes it very clean and it's also very easy to use. Feels pretty premium and nothing is pushed onto you. Tracks orders well and has some customization, good support for most carriers aswell. Definately recommend\", 'Update ** I am still really pleased with this app. This app is THE best tracking solution ever. Instead of going to all the different carriers websites and typing in numerous numbers in, this little beauty does it all for you. Never let me down yet. Thanks devs!', 'It\\'s easy to use and is very practical. Great tool. But the best this tool can improve I.e. is necessary to add the option \"to button\" to tracking number. Currently you only can move a tracking number to top but not to button.', \"This app is great for keeping track of multiple shipping companies at one convenient location. Especially fedex, who won't let me track my packages because I have them sent to my businesses. That way I don't have to set at home all day. This app sends me notices and let's me know exactly where my packages are.\", 'The fact that it auto detects the carrier 9/10 times with no mistake makes it one of the most reliable and stress-free package trackers. I wish it had a map to visualize where the packages are, and also an auto import function from major online sites such as AliExpress. It would be very nice if is showed me the photo of what my item in transit is instead of just the status icon; since I track several parcels at once, sometimes very similar. Having an \"in transit\" day counter would be great,', \"Great Info. App for your packages. Track lots of packages at the same time and add all the details you want to make your life easier. Instead of a long number you can have a title so its easier to keep track of things. Wonderful app that works perfect all of the time. Definitely would recommend to everybody. You gotta try it. I bet you'll love it as much as I do.\", 'Great app, it makes it easy to track multiple parcels and keeps you up to date via notifications. It can also show tracking between different couriers as it leaves one country and enters another.', 'Many times when tracking USPS or UPS packages, those websites do not provide tracking information. This website tracks better than the others mentioned. Overseas deliveries, which I receive often, track on this site without error.', 'Works great so far! Able to have multiple parcels tracked at the same time. System also identifies carrier service ( or at least narrows it down to a couple) when you past the tracking info', 'I like your app...but, just like any other app out there, you cannot, in most circumstances, track an international package any further than: \"Your package has departed customs of the destination country\"... NOT YOUR FAULT Edit 10/20/20: I\\'ve changed my rating to 5 stars bc it wasn\\'t fair rating at 3 for something that isn\\'t your fault (as I mentioned) I order mostly domestic now and this app is awesome with great attention to detail. Thank you.', \"App that supports ALL carriers in one. Mostly it will recognise carriers from the tracking number. Sometimes that fails & you can change the carrier name searched under. Sometimes amazon does not provide a true tracking number so tracking doesn't work. When tracking IS possible, this app does a fantastic job.\", \"There are other apps available... but this app includes several carriers not on others, e.g. SF Express. They've included a Dark Theme (personal preference for night viewing), and the interface is easy to use. As long as they don't resort to intrusive ads, this is one of the better apps available at this time.\", 'Like the auto-detect Carrier feature. Works well. Ads can be intrusive, but understood that they need to make a living... Just take too much screen real estate and way too animated at times.', 'Works great so far. It can auto detect the tracking number for the carrier most times. Others you have to guess from a small list (2 or 3 for me)', 'This app is really easy to use and saves me the trouble of going to separate carriers to check delivery status. I am even able to track packages sent to my daughter in England.', 'Update 08OCT2020..Still love this app months later. Helps me tracks my returns too. All in one interface. Great App.... Love that I can track all my online purchases and where there are in one interface. Easy to use and gives me up to date location status and even tracks my overseas purchases.', \"This app is terrible. No notifications on delivered items for any vendors. Tracking is So slow. Needs to be quicker update. Like simple things like canada post It's 1 or 2 places behind where it actually is. According to the Canada post app\"]\n",
