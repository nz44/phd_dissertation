That was a quality i really really liked. It does still give me a new homescreen pic every day, and i'm painfully trying to figure out what happened, what did i maybe do to loose the other function, but i can't find anything really changed in the settings.\", \"Stunning wallpapers with amazing quality, but I have a problem. Everytime I try to set a wallpaper for my lockscreen, it's just not working, but its perfectly fine when I want to do the same thing for my homescreen. I have a Xiaomi device with MIUI on it, but I dont think that should be a problem. Please someone help!!! Thank you\", \"I love it to look at the pictures. But usually the pictures interfere with what you can actually see on the screen. I take a screenshot with my hand over the lens so it's black. That's my. Kind of like dark mode. But it can't have colors. with my option you don't have something written in white at the bottom of a waterfall. I'm sure you'd experienced\", \"No options to Turn on Daily Wallpaper Change option in this phone, I use the same App in 3 other phones and it has option to Turn on Daily Wallpaper Change in them, but doesn't show any such option in this one: Phone - Nokia 3. Android Version: 9. Google Play Store App, Wallpaper App, Google App, System WebView, Google Play Services App, all up to Date. Phone Android and Security Update also up to date. NNNNEEEEDDDDD HEELLLPPPPPP!\", \"Would love to give a 5-star rating but I encountered two issues. First, there's very minimal choice of themes and wallpapers. Second, when I set the wallpaper for both home screen and lock screen, the wallpaper changes only for home screen and not for lock screen. Even if I try setting up the wallpaper only for lock screen it doesn't work. I use Redmi 7 (Indian Version). Please fix this.\", \"I assumed that choosing Bing wallpapers would change my screen every day but so far I have been stuck with just the one image. I have looked for more settings and done what I can. Turned on update over cellular and wifi. I'll hang onto the app for a few more days to see if it changes.\", 'preloaded wallpapers are great (some are very low resolution however) but i have a problem with the daily wallpaper option, it always defaults to setting the wallpaper to the left of the screen. i understand its because of scrolling through other pages but there are a small minority of people who only use one page and the app drawer, so pls would you allow us to change to default wallpaper position to the centre because most of the landscape photos main subjects are in the centre of the screen.', 'Awesome selection of wallpapers, however, the app has not been updated since 2017. It would be nice to see some new wallpapers. One issue I have: I try to save the wallpaper with the whale so that it is on my screen, but once I set the wallpaper, only half the whale shows! Not sure how to fix that.', \"The app has beautiful wallpapers available and makes it easy to set up. I'm having an issue with the daily wallpapers option. Whenever I try to select that feature, the app stops working and crashes, unfortunately. Besides that, it is a good app.\", \"After updating my Pixel 3a XL with the March 2020 security patch, this app has disappeared from my app drawer and I can no longer seem to open it. Google Play tells me it's installed but it is no longer visible...seems like it has been turned into a system app which is fine if, you know, I could actually use it. Also I am using Nova Launcher...I can still access if I switch to the Pixel Launcher but that is an unacceptable solution. Why would you take access away from other launchers??? Fix it!\", 'Updating my review. Unfortunately the issues I had previously mentioned are still apparent. Still unable to back out of testing wallpapers without it going to the all folders window, unable to set options such as auto change, create album, button switching etc. While clean, this app functions like an app from 2008. Google should be at the forefront in this space considering its the default app on pretty much all phones, yet here we are. Will continue to lower the score the longer this goes on.', 'We are not able to set the full picture fit,strech or fill to screen a wallpaper or a home screen apart from that there is no option also please do add a features to set a picture easily. Please fix this bugs and issues as soon as possible and i would like to rate this application to zero 0. Serious improvement needed provide update as soon as possible regards to this application.', 'Pretty good images the Daily pick is actually nice. Only two problems the image does not move when you scroll over your menu and it does not let you pick to different daily themes one for your homescreen and one for your lockscreen. Thanks', \"The wallpapers provided are very good but the biggest problem is that they have same lot of wallpapers for months now. Nothing new is being added to it's gallery which restricts us to choose.\", 'Wallpapers + Android + Pixel phone the best example of how this is completely disconnected from each other, so many bugs, still not many wallpapers support darkmode version of them, who ever the chief of UX user experience they need to learn a lot from iOS. Some wallpapers in battery saving mode they look like darkmode , but when darkmode turns automatically they look dayview.. no brains', \"Not interested in a app like this. I prefer to stick with gallery to view pics that I take or save from social media and download from Google chrome. And because wallpapers has pics zoomed in too much. Thumbs down 👎🏻 to wallpapers app 😑. Remove this app please. I don't want it on my phone.\", \"If I press download, I get a few rotations from the circle of death, then it goes away and the download button reappears as if I haven't pressed anything. I usually don't give bad reviews, but this is a silly issue. (Downloading from Wi-Fi, have the latest update)\", \"It's too bad that in name of minimalistic approach, Google removes basic features. Why can't I set a daily wallpaper only on lock screen? This app gives option either on home screen or on both lock & home screens but WHY? It's very annoying. Give all three options every time. Simple. Period.\", \"No app tile, very confusing how to access settings and make changes. The only way I can access the app is through the palystore, I search the app it say already installed but at least I can open it. My pixel 4 has no access to this app otherwise and customer support for Google one is below average the staff can't help.\", 'Knowing that Google developed the app and downloading it will give you a shock it not at all designed to Google standards and only seems to be an attempt to do something not the full try has only limited wallpaper options maybe 200 is the most you get and after a while it begins to feel overused very unhappy 🙁', \"App is good but I have a problem where I can't use daily wallpaper option because every time i close the app the wallpaper revert to the phone default one. Also i would like more features like order or a curtain set of wallpapers to be displayed and the option to change the time rate when the wallpaper change\", \"I really like the images. It's somehow not possible to set the Lockscreen wallpaper for the huawei p30 pro. It would be nice to have the ability to select how the wallpaper will be displayed, and which part of it. (Crop image, move view of picture)\", \"Some of these wallpapers are very cool, however, nobody at seem to want to add more, so the wallpaper updates are very very few. Also, on auto-refresh, there is no centering, so you get the left side of the pic only, as you can't scale or centre the pics.\", 'I like wallpapers it is very interesting to follow the patterns as they come in defferet form and colours you cannot loose the tast of it plus the flowers , many designs of doors this is new world to me.', \"Love the category set and forget! Keeps it fresh 👍🏾 Samsung has all these feature repeats - seems like they could do better to just not reinvent stuff that won't go away (like, why do we need 2 calendar apps?!!) But yeah, like this better than any of the odd looking alts in the Galaxy Store\", \"Since Dec 2019, the app has disappeared from my phone, despite it saying its installed. I don't know why this is happening considering I have a Pixel 2XL.\", 'Nokia 1 comes with this pre installed app, as this app is supposed to change home screen wallpaper as you want but unfortunately wallpaper stays for a while and then it restores to default app wallpaper.', 'Good app. Works as described. However the library if wall papers seems small as I get plenty of repeats. With Some of them particularly the architectural ones you cannot see icons and notifications on your screen. Needs to be updated with more pictures, option to add your own and other basic features. Come on Google. 1/2 a days work for one of your programmers!', 'Beautiful pictures but none of them fit the screen. They all get set off center and to big.', \"It usually stopped working and some pictures never fitted to my phone screen, so that picture ended up being a low quality and torn up. Whenever it reported app stopped working then screen turns to black and the wallpaper is gone. That's why i deleted it\", \"Same as others have had. It says it is installed, but I can't open it and it is unavailable. I also have. Google Pixel 2 XL. Anyway, I can't access this app at all.\", 'It needs more styles as far as abstract and colorful, only thing I wish was better.', 'App is good. But for solid color category an option should be given to customize the color/shades intensity. Also, for other preset wallpapers, option should be given whether the selected area of the wallpaper will remain or roll with swipe. Another option would be great if allowed to browse other images over web for setting as wallpaper.', \"Marvelous Marble is covered in a bunch of weird lines, it ruins the live wallpaper. I've switched to other live wallpapers and reset my phone but this particular wallpaper is still covered in line. Would love to see this resolved\", \"Would be perfect if it had more scenic photos. Has a lot of abstract, colors, cityscapes, etc. But very few scenic mountain, rivers, etc for all 4 seasons. Only 1 for Autumn, which happens to be my favorite season, and that's a boring picture. The best part is the wallpapers are AD FREE.\", 'Wall paper is not all that to me personally I can create wallpaper..when my camera works properly..for instance capture this view', 'Great wall paper options and easy to use. Hope this helps you.', 'Amazing wallpapers, but they need to update the selection of come alive and living universe. Adding a space-themed option with telescope photos, nebulae, galaxies, etc., would also be a good choice.', \"Doesn't allow me to just select only Lock Screen image, it has to be Home & Lock Screen or only Home. There's no Only Lock Screen option. Also I feel the categories and number of images are limited.\", 'Great app but i have an issue in android 10 Even after granting storage permission it is unable to retrieve current wallpaper and more importantly unable to select my own wallpaper from storage Plz look into it']\n",

Some of us have valid questions and comments. You need to read and edit your grammar a lot lately. Maybe do that before you post articles so you don't look ignorant. Maybe answer our questions.\", \"Good app, but they've been putting in more and more ads. I get it, you need revenue. But at least make it so you can turn off autoplay on videos! I'm tired of videos playing in there middle of an article. Completely distracting. I would've rated 4 stars before the recent onslaught of ads in the middle of every article and pinned at the bottom of the screen. Don't update if you don't want way more ads. They also censor comments, even if they don't violate their rule. Zero transparency on that.\", 'The 30 second ads before each new video are way too long. I NEVER watch the video if the ad is 30 seconds, I just close out and go to the next news story. Be like YouTube, do shorter, more interesting ads.', 'This app suscks, sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks! Streaming is terrible, and non stop ads', 'Consistently great, up-to-date app. The only problem with it is its ability to lure me in and keep me captive for long periods of time! If you are a news junkie, avoid at all cost!! Haha', 'I wish I could pick and choose what stories that appear. I don\\'t care much for ball sports, I don\\'t even open the sports section of the paper. It would be nice to block all the sports stories from appearing on my page. They need to divide their stories. It would be great to switch off the \"politics\" page too.', 'Great way to stay updated on current news, weather and current events.', \"The Notifications are very useful. However, the app is sub par. The videos hardly ever load no matter how good your connection is, and you can't read the articles on the app. Lots of room to improve\", 'Very slanted and biased news stories. There are better apps (and better news stations) out there that report Utah events much better. They censor your comments when you say something that is contrary to their biased story of beliefs.', 'I grew tired of the ultra-conservative editorial slant, being censored in my comments on stories, advertising within the story format and their over-emphasis on local sports coverage. There are better sources for Utah news.', \"This app installs just fine but then when I try to open it an error that the app has stopped working pops up. I can't even use it. Very frustrating.\", \"I have an app that force stops other apps when activated, normally all of the apps stop but this app turns itself on and waste my battery even when I am not even on this app! Ugh! No reason for it to turn itself on unless it's tracking or monitoring something. I have uninstalled it! Too bad because I like keeping informed on my home state. Oh well a competitors app it will have to be.\", 'This app is easy to use. I recently moved out of state but my family still resides there I can keep up to date with things going this allows me insight when talking with my family keeping us closer even though we now live 1000s of miles apart.', \"Hey KSL, I have enjoyed reading the news from your app every day for a long while now. I would give you 5 stars but the weather video stopped working last week. Now it's just a spinning wheel. Tried reinstalling. Still spinning. What's up/app!\", 'The app works great for simple browsing of news. I continue to have trouble loading comments on my Android phone. The app lacks the following features: general comment search, personal comment recall, personal comment history, notice to the commentor indicating his post has been accepted or rejected.', \"Very poorly built app. Due to trivial mistakes I am unable utilize this with any benefitn whatsoever. From searching stories, to avoidable frustrations when the widget is present, to attempting to view images, I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It doesn't respect the limited ability of Android lifecycle or resources. With no way to provide feedback I can only assume that KSL hired the only unqualified developers in a city chock full of professional engineers to build a seemingly simple app.\", 'For an app own by the church, they report some really depressing news. Some of the stories being reported seem like clickbait. The reporters seem to be getting desperate. Deleted this app. Have no regrets. Maybe KSL will start reporting on better stories.', 'The bottom line of each headline item is illegible most of the time. It has a red overorint that makes mostly illegible.', \"Great app if you like biased news! They only allow comments they agree with. I understand censoring vulgar language and people just being belligerent, but they take their censorship beyond that! And if they don't agree with you too many times, they'll block you permanently!\", \"I used to live in SL but live in a nearby state. The app is good and I view it daily. I don't look at the live coverage as I don't care the least bit about the advertising. It takes too long to get to the story.\", 'Really handy for news and weather updates when I need them, especially on the go. Clean and easy to navigate - and has more than just the SLC hub news! The app is well organized. 😀', 'Totally awesome app. I use it several times a day to get my news. Very responsive on feedback I have sent. The people who work on this app are great!', \"Why can't you update your weather video still picture from months ago???? Also teach your news authors how to spell and shorten story headlines properly!!! As of 2/6/19 you still CAN'T update the picture on your weather app!!\", 'Headlines for stories partially cover up pictures. Very annoying. Some stories will not load.', 'the audio only streaming will stop after 5 minutes. Frustrating to have it stop while listening to it. Even the ksl radio app does this. done with this app as it was the only thing I used', \"I wanted local news. Not Mormon news like it's time for general conference to start or a missionary in Uganda has a hangnail. Also, I would get a notification and if it was something I was interested in I would click it and then it would take me to the app where the story was nowhere to be found. Horrible news app.\", 'I can no longer view photos since the last update. Update photo viewing has been fixed. Thanks', 'Since the most recent update, photos are not viewable on the mobile app. Please fix.', 'App response is horrible. Someone hacked my information and I get the runaround to get it fixed. Still waiting...', \"Solid app but could use a face lift, been the same since it came out it seems. Also, where's the ability to see my approved/denied comments to the articles?\", 'There is no font size/style control. unreadable unless you have young eyes.', 'Never had a problem with this app working correctly until I updated yesterday. Now the app closes non stop.', 'Added advertising and it is not worth waiting and watching the same ad over and over again.', \"Can't log in after update. Been like that for months. BOOOOOOO\", 'i think its a great app. Could have some small tweaks and updates. i do enjoy the flow and layout of the app.', 'Just uninstalled because I could not disable notifications. I go to settings and uncheck it but I still get constant notifications.', 'The March update has made the app unstable and the app constantly crashes on my phone', 'keeps old news slow to update, usually after 08:00 and well after that on weekends', 'Even if you turn off notifications they will inundate you with them anyways. Very disappointing. I can get my news elsewhere without it notifying my constantly with stories they think I should see.', 'a step behind the news. same old, same old, need a bright mind or two in the organisation.']\n",

      "comments  :  [\"I wanted to say that I much preferred the thumbnail structure with the daily deals in the Shopular app before it was shut down. I don't shop as much with this app and that makes me sad. That's why I give it 3 stars for now. BUT. I've been using this app for well over a year and I wish I would have started sooner. I LOVE earning cash back on things that I have to buy weekly. This app takes patience. Your cash back is paid quarterly, but it pays with some time and effort. I recommend it.\", \"After reading the comments I think I'll just go ahead and Uninstalled before the headaches start.. It's a shame that you can't just find a app that does what it should (what it was made for) without having to jump through hoops and stand on your head just for a little extra relief when spending hard earned money...\", \"I really like this app. You have to stay on top of your cash back though because sometimes it misses it. I always double check after i place an order though so it's not so bad. I am upset they removed Wal-Mart and Amazon from this app because those were the two i used the most. I hope they put them back!\", \"App does not work. I've been a Rakuten member since ebates and it does a pretty good job online. But app is a complete failure. Could not scan my Chase Credit card. Tried 3 times to input the number and it gave me error messages all three times.\", \"I was happy with this app, at first. Looking back on the shopping trips Rakuten promised I'd get money back shopping through them, I was shocked to see how few they honored. I'm thinking of trying other apps instead. I feel ripped off.\", \"Love using RAKUTEN for much of my online shopping. I don't mind waiting for a quarterly payment. I just watch the money pot grow and I like the option to choose a gift card for payment. I'll keep using it as long as it's available.\", 'I wanted to like this program. I just cant. Takes forever to earn $. My local independent gas station has a better rewards program. All these flashy postings of HUGE cashback. Never benefitted from any of it. Its all small and not worth the time. Doing a cash back inquiry is a joke. Waste of time filling out and cutting and pasting all of that to get .33 cents. Takes forever to get credit cash back. Neat idea but if its too good to be true, it definitely is! Dont waste your time on this one.', \"Not the app for me ... I liked it but cash back didn't seem to add up very fast considering the amount of shopping I was doing and waiting 3 months for $5 at a time is frustrating. I feel dooped\", 'I love getting money back from buying the things that I would normally. I also like the fact that this app helps me find in Stock items that I need that are out of stock in stores.', \"Not good for in store offers at all. This is more about shopping online through this app. Not as advertised for sure about saving money. Would highly suggest notifying that it's truly online inly fir anything BEFORE someone signs up. Very difficult to close out acvount to protect personal info!\", 'I love that my cash back is updated so soon..just read the fine print and you will get the most out of your purchases', \"Waste of time. It takes weeks for cash back to be added to your account...if you are credited at all. When you submit an inquiry to see where your cashback dollars are (which is a challenge of its own), you get error messages and can't complete the process. Rakuten, If 0% back on a $500 purchase from Amazon was the special offer, you nailed it. Don't waste your time or data.\", \"Have been using this app for a while (when it was ebates). Love that you get cash back on purchases, however for EVERY Amazon purchase, you have to manually add your purchases.. It's ALWAYS been like this. The missing cash back is quickly added to my account when submitted,, but it's just annoying because I do almost half of my online shopping on Amazon.\", \"This is so easy! There's basically nothing to do besides shop as you normally would, and then you get money back. That's literally it. I've gotten several hundred dollars back in the past 18 months. Just do it!\", 'So far so good, there is a few months in between pay periods but at least you have a chance to build up your funds towards a refund check or PayPal. U receive a small% back from shopping, while using this app before you buy. And i love that you can choose from sooo many different stores to shop at. Thank you rakuten(Ebates) app.', 'New \"Rakuten\" doesn\\'t show my favorites or even the last used. Even when the last used is the only thing you\\'ve used it for for months. Very annoying having to type the same store in over and over even though it\\'s marked as a favorite. \"Ebates\" was much user friendlier and had a much better name.', \"I'm giving this app 3 stars ONLY because the Amazon offer was the only one I use, due to having a Prime membership, and it's GONE!! 😭😡😭 If you want my 5 star rating, bring back the Amazon offer.\", \"I haven't used the app that often, but I will leave it as 4 stars for the simple reason that the logon screen can be set up a lot better. I would suggest that when opening into the logon screen, please have some kind of popup allowing you to choose which region you're signing onto (US, Canada, Korea) before you sign on. A friend of mine and I both made the same mistake of signing onto the US site when we're in Canada, and we both ended up creating accounts on the US site, instead of signing onto our existing accounts on the Canadian site.\", \"I absolutely love this app! Especially during double cash back. So easy to get cash back for shopping. This is the best app I've used so far and I use several. I give it four stars only because I've had a few shopping trips I didn't receive cash back upon order completion but all I did was send them my order number and shopping trip number and my cash back was added. So I do have to keep track of my valid shopping trips. Aside from that issue I've never had any problems.\", \"I would give it a 5 star but everytime I click on the my profile button it doesn't go directly to the page it stays on the home page and the screen would go grey with the homepage as a background and it's taking along time to load, I waited like 20 mins for it too load and nothing at all. I never had a problem with this app. You guys need to fix it asap.\", 'Bad for In-Store shopping. This app is more online based, connecting your online shopping accounts and purchases in order to give you cash back. This app also only allows one bank account to be connected, which isn\\'t very flexible for a family. Also, if you want to take pictures of your receipts and your family\\'s receipts, this app is not for you. There is no \"receipt picture taking\" option since this app is more focused on providing coupons while you shop online; then gives u cash back online.', 'Offers can be very confusing, is it online or store why not both. Wish they had more in store .', \"Works intermittently or NOT At all. I've been using this for over a year, first year I made a good amount of money. Now, it does NOT log my shopping trips and unless I want to spend days and days going thru every transaction I'm beat out of money. I did ALL my holiday shopping and made certain it was a cash back category yet NO cash back. Customer service tells me to go thru all my trips, that will literally take a week I shop a lot. Unless you want to be frustrated find another app.\", \"Very slow to load. I can be in my home on wifi, outside on mobile and it's slow to load. Getting to load instore is impossible. I will be standing in the store, with full mobile bars lighting speed but this app will just hang, and hang. I'll go back try again and same thing happens. It's not a one time issue its constantly. Its same for online shopping. I AM upto date with app that's the first thing I looked at.\", 'I miss so much the \"Shopular\" app!! (with the sale icon) it was one of my favorite app for shopping. All the stores where accesible, the discounts where clear, I used to love the format, I was so easy to use. Now they just damage it completely with a service \"Rakuten\" that I don\\'t use or care about at all! Thanks shoddy developers!! for damaging such a great app!', \"Love this app and I make the best of it. It's easy to earn cash back and they make it very convenient to do so. Most of the places I shop at online are on their list and they also have special cash back days as well when you can earn even more money. If you use Google browser, you can link it with Rakuten and it will automatically prompt you if you're on a website that offers cash back through Rakuten.\", \"The app works like someone developed it in 2000. You can't see anything...at minimal you should be able to review your purchases through the app. Extremely frustrsting! I have the latest version.. I'm going back to my original way of purchasing. NOT WORTH THE FRUSTRATION\", \"Waaay to difficult to use. The app shows my purchase history, but the dates don't always match the dates on my receipts, and even if a store reports a purchase to Rakuten, I still have to go through the help-bot or fill out a report to get my cash back. Aren't cash back apps supposed to be relatively easy?\", \"It's nice to get cash back on purchases. Now with in store cash back it's even better.\", 'I love the app, however, I have had to log in and connect to my paypal twice so that I can get paid and twice the money disappears and never goes into my paypal. This amount then disappears. I then am expected to prove and figure out what is missing. I am very disappointed. Not sure if I should bother keeping this app.', 'This app is the best. I received a lot money . They send a check regularly and i will using forever', \"I haven't had issues with the things I've purchased not showing up like other users. However, I consistently have issues with the app shutting down on me when making a purchase if during the order process there is a drop down menu. USually it's when I'm trying to pay and the site makes me select either my state or type of credit card via a dropdown box. Highly frustrating to get that far in to the process and have to start over. It works fine on my desktop browser.\", 'Much easier than all other sites! Love shopping even more! Wonderful!', 'This app only works about 50% of the time it shuts down right before I get my order in! Very frustrating! I tried to go to there help center but live chat is NEVER available and ever time I try to send an email...it glitches and shuts down! I usually go directly to the store to order because it takes way to long to get this app to work properly. I NEVER had this problem whe it was called ebates. Very disapointed!', 'It works and you get money back but the app glitches so much! Ita only know going back do I see I got no cash back during christmas when I ordered out of their app. When contacted they only credited the most recent order I did and told me to uninstall and reinstall and didnt know why the app didnt work for weeks. You need to be on top of your orders and take screenshots during purchasing to prove you used them while shopping.', \"Love my big fat check! I have been using this app for a few years now and am amazed at how much I've gotten back! No more black fridays for me! I shop everything in the app and get that money back when the credit cards need to be paid down! I haven't used the credit card connected to the app, only one orders. Customer service has been amazing the few times that I needed to contact them.\", 'L A G For two years this app lags terribly. I hate to even refer people because its so awful. Any online store requires hitting an arrow or x several times to get it to move. Fix it for effs-sake or take it down. Oh and the zero customer service is awesome. Its 2020, time to step it up a notch. Spend less money on commercials and improve your app.', 'I shop at several places eligible for cash back but I\\'m unable to collect because I there\\'s no way to scan my receipt after I shop and after several failed attempts I\\'ve given up on syncing them before I shop, but they\\'re so quick to tell email me after I shop and say\"ooops you could of got money back\" therefore this app only leads to frustration!!', 'Love it! Cash back on things I have to buy anyway. It just makes sense.', 'Very convenient and easy to use. Makes shopping a breeze. 😊']\n",
